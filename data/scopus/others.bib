abstract={In this work we show how concepts and methods from actuarial risk theory can be applied to risk analysis in industry. Risk analysis consists in identifying, quantifying and classifying or ordering risks. In the proposed methodology, the risks identified in industrial setting, are modeled by loss random variables. The loss random variables are used to calculate the expected loss, the loss variance and exceedance probabilities permitting risk quantification. In order to classify and order risks, besides measures of uncertainty, risk measures, such as Value-at Risk and Tail-Value-at-Risk (or Expected Shortfall) are determined and, together with risk quantification, the risk levels are analysed. To exemplify this methodology, a case study for risk analysis and classification of occupational accidents in the furniture industry was carried out. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The main objective of this paper is to perform a risk analysis for the key commercial fish species in the FAO area 27 by means of a bundle of financial left-tail risk indicators, including Value-at-Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) and Expectiles (EX), and panel data of catches (Qit) to measure the left-tail risk of catches (LTRi); an empirical and probabilistic measure of the worst-case reduction of catches resulting from huge negative shocks. LTRi can be useful, not only to classify the fish species according to their risk level, but also, using the appropriate weights, to infer the risk to any other aggregation level such as fleet, fishing community or fishing country. In this paper, we are employing our species level (LTRi) estimations to calculate the left-tail risk of catches of the EU fishing countries (LTRj), a country level proxy variable for the risk inherent to the fishing activity itself. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={In this study, we assess and estimate the market risk of firms that use clean energy technologies in their production process by using the expected shortfall (ES) regression-based backtest approach and value at risk (VaR) method. We use the WilderHill Clean energy Index from 2001 to 2018 and jointly assess the tail distribution of the risk model. Our findings show that ES forecast results are not misleading during the financial turmoil or during the full sample period. Therefore, our findings indicate that the ES approach can be an alternative valuable diagnostic tool to VaR for the estimation of market risk for financial institutions and regulators. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Large-scale wind power access may bring about potential safety risks to the load recovery process under extreme output scenarios. In order to cope with this problem, firstly, the predicted wind power outputs and the extreme output value are obtained by using the Copula theory, the Latin hypercube sampling and the value-at-risk (VAR) method. Secondly, based on the analysis of the active static security region (ASSR) of the load recovery time steps, the safety adjustment factors that characterizes the active power adjustment margins of different load nodes are proposed. Furthermore, by taking the load importance and safety adjustment factor as the weighting factors to measure the restoration values, the load restoration mixed integer non-linear programming (MILP) model with the optimization goal of maximizing the time step restoration value is established and solved with the CPLEX. Having the example of the IEEE-39 node system, the simulation results show that adjusting the restoration plan according to security region check results of the restoration plan in the extreme wind power output scenario, the load restoration effect and the safety of the restoration process are balanced. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

abstract={Hybrid ground-coupled heat pump systems can efficiently heat and cool buildings by exchanging heat with geological materials. Their sizing is, however, complex and their financial profitability is hard to establish during the design phase due to uncertainties that taint important design parameters. Historically, impacts of uncertainties are assessed after sizing completion using sensitivity analyses. Unfortunately, these analyses cannot mitigate design risks, should the consequences of uncertainties be significant. Here, we show how the net present value-at-risk, a stochastic financial indicator inspired by a metric used in the financial sector, can weave the impacts of uncertainties throughout the design phase. The net present value-at-risk is compared to the net present value in a case study that considers uncertainty of construction costs, building's heat load, energy tariffs and ground thermal conductivity. Results show that this financial indicator, although it comes at a higher computational price than traditional net present value indicator, leads to shorter payback periods, greatly reduces the risks of unforeseen financial losses and does not require further sensitivity analysis. By describing uncertain parameters with statistical distributions during sizing, the proposed designs are more conservative, still efficient and financially viable while being shielded from worst case scenarios. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To maintain financial stability and to effectively manage risk, an insurer will partially reinsure the loss to a reinsurance company. Two of the most often used reinsurance contracts are quota-share and stop-loss. In quota-share, the loss will be split based on a fixed proportion and the reinsurance premium depends on the value of the proportion, while in stop-loss the loss will be split depending on the retention value. In the hope that these two types of reinsurance can cover each other weaknesses, this study combines both quota-share and stop-loss reinsurance. Subsequently, to get a good coverage for the insurer, it is necessary to find the optimal proportion and retention value. One way to do so is using risk measure optimization. The smaller the value of the risk measure, the smaller the loss borne by the insurer. The risk measure used in this paper is Conditional-Tail-Expectation (CTE), where it involves Value-at-Risk (VaR) in its calculation. Calculated using the expected value principle, the reinsurance premium is used as a constraint in the CTE optimization for each of the reinsurance combinations, which are stop-loss after quota-share and quota-share after stop-loss. By optimizing CTE, it is found that each combination produces the same minimal CTE, so both reinsurance combinations are optimal for use by the insurer. By using different distributions, it is seen that the minimal CTE depends on the distribution's tail behavior. Furthermore, in determining the minimal value, the conditions that are used in optimization using CTE are different from VaR. © 2021 Author(s).},

abstract={Urban green infrastructure has become an important concept for sustainable urban devel-opment. Regarding the joining up of green spaces into green networks, it can have major positive impacts on the environment, societies and economies, and ecology. This study proposes a value model for investing in urban green infrastructure, with impact factors including land use value, energy conservation value, carbon reduction, and disaster prevention value. It establishes that through the interaction between all four of these factors, urban green infrastructure investment increases net operating income. Additionally, as disaster prevention value increases, urban disaster risk declines, and this has an important positive effect on overall value. Our modeling also indicates that in the face of climatic extremes, the construction of urban green infrastructure is increasingly important, particularly in terms of energy value and disaster prevention value. Specific incentives and catalysts for promoting investment in urban green infrastructure are proposed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The development of circular economies due to the limitation of natural resources is becoming a common strategy of paramount importance among different countries. In Spain, given the strategic nature of its olive industry, trying to value one of its main residuals (olive pomace) alone or together with other residues through its chemical transformation in methanol is a promising research line. One of the key variables that would make the investment advisable or not is the future value of the methanol price. However, most of the literature do not consider its future price volatility on the economic evaluation of the chemical processes. This work bridges that gap by proposing three econometric models based on Unobserved Components to forecast the methanol price over the life cycle plant. Those probabilistic forecasts feed a Monte Carlo simulation that provides an exhaustive investment risk assessment in terms of Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return and Value at Risk metrics. The results showed the relationship between forecasting models and the investment profitability with an average Internal Rate of Return ranging from 23% to 31%. Additionally, the previous analysis was completed by adding other variables subject to uncertainty (olive pomace feed, capital investment, feedstock price, labor costs and discount rate).

abstract={Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Tail Loss (ETL) are two risk measures that are used frequently to measure the investment risk. Even though VaR can estimate maximum loss when the investor holds a single asset in a particular period and interval confidence, the investor frequently develops a portfolio of assets. This condition can create shared risk among assets in the portfolio so that there will be a chance of an asset for getting loss caused by the other assets developing the portfolio. On the other hand, there is a fact that VaR cannot provide loss information at the tail loss part so that we also need ETL that can overcome this problem. Because of that reason, this paper uses Credible Value at Risk (CredVaR) and Credible Expected Tail Loss (CredETL), which are formulated based on the Buhlman credibility concept. Both methods can estimate an investment risk that can overcome the shortcoming of VaR and ETL that do not consider the risk among assets inside the portfolio. The application of both methods was utilized to evaluate the individual risk of each asset in a portfolio comprised of five stocks in the LQ-45 Index (period of February 2019 until July 2019). The data divided into ten periods of risk analysis comprises of ten-year daily data of each stock from June 2009 to May 2019. According to the result of the analysis, it can be concluded that both methods are powerful in measuring the risk. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The use of mulching in agriculture suppresses the weeds around crop plants, enhances the nutrients status of soil, controls the soil structure and temperature, and reduces soil water evaporation. Excessive use of low-density polyethylene mulches is contributing to the accumulation of high amounts of plastic wastes, an environmental problem for agricultural ecosystems. Fragments of plastic from such wastes can be found in soils, in water resources, and in organisms, including humans. The objective of this work was to study the economic viability of the use of different hydromulches in an artichoke crop. Three blends were prepared by mixing paper pulp (recycled from used paper) and cardboard (from paper mills) with different additives: wheat straw (WS), rice hulls (RH), and substrate used for mushroom cultivation (MS). These were compared with low-density polyethylene (Pe), a treatment without mulching on bare soil where hand weeding was performed (HW), and a treatment without mulching on bare soil where herbicide was applied (H). The results indicate that the use of hydromulch in an artichoke crop represents a good alternative for reducing plastic waste in agriculture. The net profits of the hydromulch treatments (MS, WS, RH) were higher than for HW and H, and slightly lower than for Pe. The most profitable treatment was Pe (€0.69 m−3), followed by RH (€0.59 m−3), WS (€0.58 m−3), MS (€0.47 m−3), HW (€0.36 m−3), and H (€0.32 m−3). A sensitivity analysis showed a probability of negative results of 0.04 in Pe, 0.13 in SM, 0.08 in WS, and 0.07 in RH, so the probability that the grower will make a profit is greater than 0.9 with the use of mulch (except mushroom substrate) or polyethylene. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={In order to reflect the impact of wind power fluctuation on the overall operation risk of the power system in the future time periods, this paper establishes the load shedding risk change indicators, the line overload risk change indicators and voltage violation risk change indictors, and designs a three-layer assessment indicators with a progressive relationship in the power system with large-scale wind power integration based on the value at risk theory. Firstly, the assessment indicators in the first layer such as the load shedding risk indicator, the line overload risk indicator and the voltage violation risk indicator are calculated based on the wind power prediction output sequence. Secondly, synthesizing the results of the first layer assessment indicators at all moments and using the logistic distribution and exponential distribution to describe the probability distribution of each indicator, the value at risk theory is introduced to calculate the second layer indicators that reflect the overall risk level of the system in the future time periods, and the comprehensive risk indicators that are used as the third layer indicators are introduced to comprehensively evaluate the power system operation risks. Finally, the rationality of the proposed model and method is verified with the analysis in the IEEE-RTS79 system. This paper further analyzes the impact of different wind farm access nodes or access capacities and wind farm centralized access or decentralized access on the system operation risks. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

abstract={In mountain environments, precise rockfall risk evaluation is crucial to reduce death tolls and costs. However, to date, existing rockfall risk assessment procedures remain scarce, as they focus only on existing elements at risk and with the damage expectation as sole risk measure. Here, we propose an approach to evaluate the distribution of damages on an individual basis as a continuous function of space. Furthermore, rockfall risk is evaluated through (i) the damage expectation and based on (ii) the value-at-risk (VAR) and (iii) the expected shortfall (ES). VaR and ES risk measures allow better assessing the risk due to extreme events and accounting for various short-term/long-term constraints faced by stakeholders. This procedure is applied to Le Brocey slope (municipality of Crolles, French Alps), frequently affected by rockfall events, illustrating its potential for land-use planning. Notably, obtained individual risk values can be confronted with acceptability thresholds to perform legal zoning on sound basis. Also, they allow comparison of risk management strategies as function of different behaviors towards risk, budgetary constraints and/or temporal horizons. Hence, the approach provides valuable tools for future land-use planning and decision-making. It could easily be transferred to other hazards as a wider contribution to the determination of the best balance between safety and sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Risk is a probability of loss. In financial terms, loss can be interpreted as a possibility that an actual return on an investment will be lower than expected returns. Recent studies develop a new type of risk measures called credible value at risk (CrVaR). Credible value at risk is a model obtained by combining credibility theory and one of the most used risk measures, value at risk (VaR). Credibility theory is a model which gives a proper weight for both information and VaR is used to calculate maximum loss with the specific level of certainty and specific time frame. The combination of credibility theory and VaR is required to get a better value at risk estimation based on individual and group experiences. This paper discusses the model of credible value at risk, its parameter estimation, and focuses on the implementation of credible value at risk to predict the future rate of return from Indonesia's stock market data. © 2021 Journal of Physics: Conference Series.},

abstract={Every insurance companies have a capacity limit related to the maximum claim that can be borne. Therefore, insurance companies need to reinsure risks to reinsurance companies. Besides of quota-share, types of reinsurance contracts that commonly used is stop-loss. The quota-share reinsurance premium is proportional based on the amount claim that is covered, but not safe against a large claim. While for stop-loss, the reinsurance premium is relatively large but safe for a large claim. So, this paper combines both types of reinsurance to cover the shortcomings with their respective strengths. After being combined, it is necessary to determine the optimal quota-share proportion and stop-loss retention. One criterion of determines optimal proportion and retention is based on Value-at-Risk (VaR) optimization. With the reinsurance premium as a constraint, this optimization problem is solved for each type of reinsurance combination, be it quota-share before stop-loss or stop-loss before quota-share. From each of these types combinations, the result is optimal quota-share proportion and stop-loss retention, so as produce a minimum VaR value from the borne risk by insurance companies. by comparing the results of VaR optimization of these combinations, stop-loss before quota-share is obtained resulting in a more minimum VaR value. © 2021 Journal of Physics: Conference Series.},

abstract={To assess the time-varying dynamics in value-at-risk (VaR) estimation, this study has employed an integrated approach of dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models on daily stock return of the emerging markets. A daily log-returns of three leading indices such as KSE100, KSE30, and KSE-ALL from Pakistan Stock Exchange and SSE180, SSE50 and SSE-Composite from Shanghai Stock Exchange during the period of 2009–2019 are used in DCC-GARCH modeling. Joint DCC parametric results of stock indices show that even in the highly volatile stock markets, the bivariate time-varying DCC model provides better performance than traditional VaR models. Thus, the parametric results in the DCC-GRACH model indicate the effectiveness of the model in the dynamic stock markets. This study is helpful to the stockbrokers and investors to understand the actual behavior of stocks in dynamic markets. Subsequently, the results can also provide better insights into forecasting VaR while considering the combined correlational effect of all stocks. © The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={This study evaluates the impact of Covid-19 variables which has attracted huge attention from whole countries. The service companies listed in IDX are being the main issue while many are struggling amidst the economy slowdown due to pandemy. By comparing the time series regression (TSR) - GARCHX and ARMAX - GARCHX of stock return of 4 companies listed in service sub-sector since early March 2020, proposed GARCHX models are able to assess the volatility of stock return. As a proxy of the volatility, Value-at-Risk (VAR) is analyzed at 1% and 5% quantiles. It is found that ARMAX-GARCHX is more accurate than TSR-GARCHX in evaluating the volatility in lower risk, particularly that of medical service stock. Through ARMAX-GARCHX model, it is indicated that JCI return and lagged Covid-19 daily death cases have significant impact to the stock volatility, particularly that of transportation and medical service companies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Because of Taiwan’s specific geographical location, disastrous weather phenomena such as typhoons, extreme rainfall, flooding, and regional flooding occur frequently, resulting in devastating casualties and property loss. The losses caused by flooding are NT$5.5 billion per year. This study used insurance claims data on flood damage in Taiwan’s transportation construction projects (from 1996 to 2007) as a sample space. Statistical actuarial model analysis was performed to normalize the loss factors, thereby enabling loss model testing and quantitative analysis of the normalized loss factors. To evaluate the risk in transportation construction, two models were separately applied in the analysis: the value at risk and riskiness models. The results may aid in estimating flooding damage losses in transportation construction projects. © 2021 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.},

In order to efficiently solve the BRO problem, we derive nested stochastic gradient estimators and propose corresponding stochastic approximation algorithms. We show that our gradient estimators are asymptotically unbiased and consistent, and that the algorithms converge asymptotically. We demonstrate the empirical performance of the algorithms on a two-sided market model. Our estimators are of independent interest in extending the literature of stochastic gradient estimation to the case of nested risk measures. © Copyright © 2021 “IISE”.},

abstract={Due to the uncertainty of the external situation and the varied ability of electric vehicle (EV) owners to understand and process information, the demand response optimization method is not timely and flexible enough. This article puts forward a two-stage electric vehicle automatic demand response (ADR) optimization method based on generalized Glue value-at-risk (GGlueVaR) to solve existing problems. First, a two-stage electric vehicle ADR optimization method is proposed considering both the EV owner's benefit and network load fluctuation. In the process of ADR, different risk preferences of electric vehicle owners affect the EV owner participation in ADR. Second, the GGlueVaR-based EV owner willingness decision model is adopted to measure an EV group's risk attitude. Finally, a case study is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed model reduced the average charging cost of EV owners by 45% and increased the profit resulting from DR by 91% compared with the price-based demand response model. Therefore, the proposed model is more efficient than disorder charging model. The method is timelier and more flexible compared with other prior demand response optimization methods. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Even if the mortgage lending value is not included among the bases of valuation recognized by the International Valuation Standards, the consequences of the global financial crisis have pointed out the peremptoriness for the banking institutions to adopt, in the transactions that involve properties as credit exposure guarantees, sustainable value judgments in the long term. In the present work, with reference to the Italian context, a rational method for estimating the mortgage lending value is proposed and tested. By borrowing the operating logic of the Value at Risk and introducing appropriate assumptions, the model is based on a time series analysis of the property values recorded in the Italian regional capitals, and assesses the abatement coefficients of the market value according to the location of the urban area (central, semi-central or peripheral) of the property. The coefficients obtained satisfy the need for a rational assessment of the property risk and for an appropriate spatial contextualization of the risk components as regards the local demand and supply. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper develops a method for assessing portfolio tail risk based on extreme value theory. The technique applies separate estimations of univariate series and allows for closed-form expressions for Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall. Its forecasting ability is tested on a portfolio of U.S. stocks. The in-sample goodness-of-fit tests indicate that the proposed approach is better suited for portfolio risk modeling under extreme market movements than comparable multivariate parametric methods. Backtesting across multiple quantiles demonstrates that the model cannot be rejected at any reasonable level of significance, even when periods of stress are included. Numerical simulations corroborate the empirical results. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Using the quantile GARCH model estimators to gauge the bidirectional risk magnitude and the Granger causality test in risk distributions to detect the existence of risk spillovers, this paper explores the extreme risk spillovers of China’s regional carbon markets to local listed firm’s stock returns. From the perspectives of macro region level and micro firm level, the findings are outlined as follows. First, among the top three active carbon trading pilots (Hubei, Guangdong, and Shenzhen), Hubei pilot exhibits significant “low risk and high profit” features. Second, the predominant risk spillover effects to local listed firms are heterogeneous across pilots. Specifically, Hubei pilot is dominated by “up-to-down” effect, and Guangdong pilot is dominated by “down-to-down” effect, while Shenzhen pilot has no predominant effect. The heterogeneous risk spillover performance may be caused by the regional divergence in economic development, industry structure, and cap setting concerning each pilot. Third, the risk transmission performance from carbon allowance price to local listed firm’s stock returns depends on the firm’s belonging sector. That is, environment-related firms, either environment-friendly firms or pollution-intensive firms, are more susceptible to carbon markets’ risks compared with environment-unrelated firms. This paper supplies novel information on the risk transmission from carbon markets to local economic entities, which proves valuable not only for firms to improve risk aversion ability but also for policy-makers to perfect carbon markets’ mechanism. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Extreme financial events usually lead to sharp jumps in stock prices and volatilities. In addition, jump clustering and stock price correlations contribute to the risk amplification acceleration mechanism during the crisis. In this paper, four Jump-GARCH models are used to forecast the jump diffusion volatility, which is used as the risk factor. The linear and asymmetric nonlinear effects are considered, and the value at risk of banks is estimated by support vector quantile regression. There are three main findings. First, in terms of the volatility process of bank stock price, the Jump Diffusion GARCH model is better than the Continuous Diffusion GARCH model, and the discrete jump volatility is significant. Secondly, due to the difference of the sensitivity of abnormal information shock, the jump behavior of bank stock price is heterogeneous. Moreover, CJ-GARCH models are suitable for most banks, while ARJI-R2-GARCH models are more suitable for small and medium sized banks. Thirdly, based on the jump diffusion volatility information, the performance of the support vector quantile regression is better than that of the parametric quantile regression and nonparametric quantile regression. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Purpose: To introduce a new optimization algorithm that improves DVH results and is designed for the type of heterogeneous dose distributions that occur in brachytherapy. Methods: The new optimization algorithm is based on a prior mathematical approach that uses mean doses of the DVH metric tails. The prior mean dose approach is referred to as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), and unfortunately produces noticeably worse DVH metric results than gradient-based approaches. We have improved upon the CVaR approach, using the so-called Truncated CVaR (TCVaR), by excluding the hottest or coldest voxels in the structure from the calculations of the mean dose of the tail. Our approach applies an iterative sequence of convex approximations to improve the selection of the excluded voxels. Data Envelopment Analysis was used to quantify the sensitivity of TCVaR results to parameter choice and to compare the quality of a library of 256 TCVaR plans created for each of prostate, breast, and cervix treatment sites with commercially-generated plans. Results: In terms of traditional DVH metrics, TCVaR outperformed CVaR and the improvements increased monotonically as more iterations were used to identify and exclude the hottest/coldest voxels from the optimization problem. TCVaR also outperformed the Eclipse-Brachyvision TPS, with an improvement in PTVD95% (for equivalent organ-at-risk doses) of up to 5% (prostate), 3% (breast), and 1% (cervix). Conclusions: A novel optimization algorithm for HDR treatment planning produced plans with superior DVH metrics compared with a prior convex optimization algorithm as well as Eclipse-Brachyvision. The algorithm is computationally efficient and has potential applications as a primary optimization algorithm or quality assurance for existing optimization approaches. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd},

abstract={Water distribution networks (WDNs), as vital systems of any city, are vulnerable to the intrusion of contamination, and the security of WDNs is of great importance. A promising approach for the protection of WDNs against such threats is to deploy contaminant detection sensors in the network. One of the modeling strategies to identify an appropriate configuration of sensors is the expectation-based model. In this model, the location of sensors is determined so that the expected impact of contamination events is minimized. In this work, we consider two existing expectation-based models that have been presented in the literature. Although both models identified the same optimal sensor placements, choosing the better model in practical implementation may not be clear to practitioners, who must consider complexity and resolution times. This work first answers this question and proves that both models have the same quality - and hence, in terms of solution time, it makes no difference which model is used. As the second contribution of this work, the expectation-based model is extended to incorporate worst-case, value-at-risk (VaR), and conditional VaR (CVaR) measures. Computational results compare the damage of risk-based models with real-world WDNs, and indicate that the CVaR-based model may be an excellent approach to address risk measures in this problem. The CVaR-based model optimizes the CVaR measure and, at the same time, does not cause a significant increase in the optimal value of other risk measures. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={With the increasing proportion of distributed energy resources (DER) penetrated into the distribution power systems, Microgrids are widely used in the operation of power system. Renewable energy generation is known to be uncertain and volatile. Incentive-Based Demand Response (IBDR) is a good option to reduce the effect of this drawbacks because it has better timeliness and lower cost than other method. In this paper, a versatile hierarchical demand response strategy is proposed. With the determination of hierarchical incentive coefficients and the corresponding response quantities, the rebound effect considered dynamic DR decision-making strategy is established to optimize the total costs of residents. In order to verify the effectiveness of the strategy in cost saving, Monte Carlo algorithm is used for verification, where the optimization rate under the fluctuant price and stochastic power vacancy is calculated. Besides, two types of participating users were considered in the response results, and the confidence intervals for the response quantities under different price were calculated. The result shows the effectiveness of this strategy in reducing cost while the deficiency of DER occurs. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In this study, we analyze the risk of extreme value dependence in Chinese regional carbon emission markets. After filtering the daily return data of six carbon markets in China using a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, we obtain the standardized residual series. Next, the dependence structures in the markets are captured by the Copula function and the Extreme Value theory (EVT). We report high peaks, heavy tails and fluctuation aggregation in the logarithm return series of the markets, as well as significant dependent structures. There are significant extreme value risks in Chinese regional carbon markets, but the risks can be mitigated through appropriate portfolio diversification. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The research aims to identify and analyze the sources of risk from the input and output markets of the vaname shrimp hatchery business, and to find strategies to overcome the risks. The study was conducted in June-August 2019 in the Barru Regency, South Sulawesi Province. Survey research type. Descriptive analysis methods are used to explain the source of risk. Value at Risk (VaR) is used to analyze the source of risk, and the analysis of preventive strategies is used to find strategies to minimize risk. The results of the study: (1) sources of input market risk consist of feed prices with a probability of 36.53% and a parent price with a probability of 25.93%. Sources of output market risk; consist of fry prices with a probability of 44.74%. and fry sales with a probability of 78.52%. (2) sources of feed price risk are in quadrant II, and sources of risk for parent prices, fry prices, and fry sales are in quadrant III. (3) strategies for overcoming risks, namely making feed purchase contracts for the stability of feed and parent prices, market control, management control, and distribution supervision to the consumer level. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In classic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), action costs and transition probabilities are assumed to be known, although an accurate estimation of these parameters is often not possible in practice. This study addresses MDPs under cost and transition probability uncertainty and aims to provide a mathematical framework to obtain policies minimizing the risk of high long-term losses due to not knowing the true system parameters. To this end, we utilize the risk measure value-at-risk associated with the expected performance of an MDP model with respect to parameter uncertainty. We provide mixed-integer linear and nonlinear programming formulations and heuristic algorithms for such risk-averse models of MDPs under a finite distribution of the uncertain parameters. Our proposed models and solution methods are illustrated on an inventory management problem for humanitarian relief operations during a slow-onset disaster. The results demonstrate the potential of our risk-averse modeling approach for reducing the risk of highly undesirable outcomes in uncertain/risky environments. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 “IISE”.},

abstract={As the companies have grown larger, the salmon farming industry has received increased attention from investors, financial analysts and other representatives of the financial community. Still, little is known about the risk and return characteristics of salmon farming companies’ shares. This paper approaches this topic by applying quantile regression to investigate the relationship between risk factors and monthly stock price returns over the entire return distribution at both industry and firm level. The results show that the overall market return, changes in the salmon price and the lagged returns for the major company in the industry have a positive impact on company stock price returns. The risk factor sensitivities are quite stable across quantiles at industry-level, there are substantial differences at the firm level, but formal testing cannot reject the hypothesis that the quantiles are equal. This implies that the relationship between risk factors and stock returns may vary under different return levels reflected in the salmon price cycles. We show how the results can be implemented and applied in a Value-at-Risk analysis. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={In the deregulated electricity market, power producers are exposed to risks of generation imbalance and decreasing earnings. In order to stabilize earnings, they need to make generation plan of their own generators and bidding plan to the electricity market in consideration of these risks. These risks are due to uncertainties of forecasts of electricity price, renewable energy generation, electricity demand, and so on. Up to now, there are many studies about stochastic unit commitment methods considering these risks. However, conventional methods have problems that operators have difficulty in reflecting risk appetite intuitively. In this study, we present a stochastic unit commitment method which optimizes VaR (Value at Risk) of profit with a given confidence level. A confidence level means the percent of event which operators consider for risks to all events, so operators can reflect own risk appetite intuitively. The usefulness of the proposed method has been confirmed by numerical simulation. The numerical results show that when a power producer has low risk tolerance, the volume of forward contract increases. Studying efficient calculation methods and formulations and the evaluation using actual scenario are future tasks. © 2020 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.},

abstract={We propose a new approach to model the dependence structure for aggregating the risk of flood damages from a local level to larger areas, which is based on the structure of the river network of a country and can be calibrated with publicly available data of river discharges. Building upon a suitable adaptation of max-stable processes for a flood-relevant geometry as recently introduced in the literature, this enables the assessment of flood risk without the need for a hydrological model, and can easily be adapted for different countries. We illustrate its use for the particular case of Austria. We first develop marginal flood models for individual municipalities by intertwining available HORA risk maps with the actual location of buildings. As a second alternative for the marginal modeling, we advocate an approach based on suitably normalized historical damage data of municipalities together with techniques from extreme value statistics. We implement and compare the two alternatives and apply the calibrated dependence structure to each of them, leading to estimates for average flood damage as well as its extreme quantiles on the municipality, state, and country level. This also allows us to quantify the diversification potential for flood risk on each of these levels, a topic of considerable importance in view of the natural and strong spatial dependence of this particular natural peril. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={This study aims to examine the performance of government development financing sukuk/SBSN compared with bonds/SUN period 2014-2017. The method used is descriptive quantitative with secondary data. The data obtained were analyzed and concluded based on a predetermined framework. The results of the analysis based on the method of efficiency ratio, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Value at Risk (VaR) shown that SUN has high efficiency and high risk, while SBSN has low efficiency and low risk. Based on the analysis of the Efficient Portfolio Frontier shown that an efficient portfolio exists at risk level to 0.14% and profit rate up to 369.31% exist in the proportion of 60% SBSN financing and 40% SUN financing proportion, it means that the Sukuk financing portfolio was better rather than Bonds financing portfolio. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With more distributed energy resources penetrated into the residential community, nanogrid based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market has rapidly emerged over recent years. Due to the complexities on the decision-making process of each market participant, an efficient, fair and beneficial oriented bidding strategy is thus necessary. In this article, a two-stage bidding strategy for P2P trading of nanogrid is proposed. To overcome the limitations of traditional methods, in the first stage, a supply-demand relationship considered two-step price predictor, which aims to promote the usage of local renewable energy, is formulated to provide the guidance on transaction adjustment. In the second stage, trading preference based simultaneous game-theoretic approach is fully introduced, which can optimize the market equilibrium and then increase the social welfare of the P2P market. Additionally, to mitigate the possible failure of price matching, value-at-risk is implemented through the trading process as a risk hedging tool. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, usages of local renewable energy, economic benefits and success rates of transaction is compared against the traditional method for various cases. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Deregulation of power industry has entailed important changes in the energy market. With the power industry being restructured, a generation company (GenCo) sells energy through auctions in a daily market, and submission of the appropriate amount of electricity with the right bidding price is important for a GenCo to maximize their profits and minimize the acceptance risk. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel approach for determination of the optimal biding patterns among GenCos in the deregulated power market using a hybrid of Markowitz Model and Genetic Algorithm (GA). While Markowitz Model as an optimization model considers the risk premium for biding patterns and GA as a search engine, considering the acceptance risk in deregulated market. A case study is used to examine the findings of the proposed approach. Also, to compare the proposed model, neural network by back propagation learning algorithm and real proposed pattern were considered. The numerical results indicate that the proposed model is statistically efficient and offers effective curves and biding patterns by lesser risk and equal profitability in day-ahead market as it is able to achieve better results compared to the neural network. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An insurance contract implies that risk is ceded from ordinary policy holders to companies. Companies do the same thing between themselves as well. The rationale could be the same; i.e., that a financially weaker agent is passing risk to a stronger one. In reality even the largest companies do this to diversify risk, and financially the cedent may be as strong as the reinsurer. The problem of determining reinsurance contracts which are optimal with respect to some reasonable criterion has been studied extensively within actuarial science. Different contact types are considered such as stop-loss contracts where the reinsurance company covers risk above a certain level, and insurance layer contracts where the reinsurance company covers risk within an interval. The contracts are then optimized with respect to some risk measure, such as value-at-risk or conditional tail expectation. In the present paper we consider the problem of minimizing value-at-risk in the case of multiple insurance layer contracts. Such contracts are known to be optimal in the univariate case, and the optimal contract is easily determined. In the multivariate case, however, finding an optimal set of contracts is not easy. By considering solutions where the risk is balanced between the contracts, we show how to find a solution using an efficient iterative Monte Carlo method. We also consider more general unbalanced solutions for which a slightly more complex optimization method must be applied. The methods are illustrated by numerical examples. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={Good decisions, in design or operation stages, positively impact system performances and can prevent it form suffering undesired scenarios and their consequences, in a uncertain environment. Using Robust Optimization (RO), a so-called chance-constraint, here denoted as risk-constraint as it embeds the preferences of the decision maker with respect to risk tolerance, can be enforced to ensure that the obtained solution of the decision problem is acceptable in this regard. Yet, this solution will only be as good as the knowledge of the uncertain environment that is used in the decision-making process. In this paper, we study the possibility for the decision-maker to refine its knowledge of the system in its operating environment, through information collection. The concept of Value of Information (VoI) is used to quantify potential improvements in decisions outcomes that may be achieved through a modification of the state of knowledge and a reduction in uncertainty. In particular, using decisions that are conditioned on an environment with reduced uncertainty, it is often possible to lower the level of risk for a given total operating cost (or Value-at-Risk) or vice versa. Hence, in a wide sense, knowledge acquisition may represent a step towards adopting a more robust attitude, with respect to risk, when making decisions. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={Protecting Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) from cyber attacks requires properly allocating defense resources. These can be selected by defend-attack and Adversarial Risk Analysis (ARA) models, which search for the optimal allocation based on specific assumptions. In particular, the defend-attack model assumes that each player is fully aware of the preferences of the opponent, considering complete information, whereas the ARA model assumes incomplete information and subjective probability distributions of the defender utilities, improving the realism of the modelling but still lacking a proper management of the uncertainties of the results it provides. In this work, we complement the ARA model with a multi-criteria decision model based on Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures to support the defender in identifying the optimal defense portfolio among alternatives, considering budget constraints and accounting for the uncertainties which the ARA model is subjected to. For demonstration purposes, an application is carried out concerning the digital control system of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED). © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={An insurance contract implies that risk is ceded from ordinary policy holders to companies. Companies do the same thing between themselves as well. The rationale could be the same; i.e., that a financially weaker agent is passing risk to a stronger one. In reality even the largest companies do this to diversify risk, and financially the cedent may be as strong as the reinsurer. The problem of determining reinsurance contracts which are optimal with respect to some reasonable criterion has been studied extensively within actuarial science. Different contact types are considered such as stop-loss contracts where the reinsurance company covers risk above a certain level, and insurance layer contracts where the reinsurance company covers risk within an interval. The contracts are then optimized with respect to some risk measure, such as value-at-risk or conditional tail expectation. In the present paper we consider the problem of minimizing value-at-risk in the case of multiple insurance layer contracts. Such contracts are known to be optimal in the univariate case, and the optimal contract is easily determined. In the multivariate case, however, finding an optimal set of contracts is not easy. By considering solutions where the risk is balanced between the contracts, we show how to find a solution using an efficient iterative Monte Carlo method. We also consider more general unbalanced solutions for which a slightly more complex optimization method must be applied. The methods are illustrated by numerical examples. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

abstract={This paper combines the practical activities of the supply chain with existing theories to explore new ways to measure financial risks in the supply chain. We establish a supply chain financial risk measurement index system based on the VaR model, and use the Monte Carlo simulation method to conduct empirical analysis. The results show that banks can use the VaR model to investigate the business status of the enterprise according to the financial data such as profit rate and return on assets in the actual operation of these enterprises. At the same time, the β value is introduced on the basis of the traditional VaR model. The use of the VaR model and the β value can help the bank to quantitatively screen the financing object according to its own risk preference. When the β value of the enterprise with financing demand is greater than the set value, then the bank will without lending, the β value also helps banks scientifically allocate financing quotas and effectively control risks. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Crop insurance is a potential business line to develop, especially in countries with agricultural bases. In such type of insurance, a loss can be defined as a lack of revenue resulted from the crop yield or the price. The purpose of this paper is to model the variability of revenue-based agricultural losses through the implementation of time-varying copula towards crop yield and price, and to estimate the indemnity of the revenue-based crop insurance. The analysis employs both static and time-varying Normal and Archimedean copula to model the structure of dependency between crop yield and price. Each marginal variable is modeled using ARIMA model. A simple algorithm is proposed to estimate revenue-based losses and indemnity of the revenue-based crop insurance. © 2019 Author(s).},

abstract={Managers and capital masters of companies and factories try to adopt methods that maximize their profit and minimize their costs. A way for increasing profit is risk management. The risk management and the type of risk are defined in the literature of financial management. For measurement of the risk, many methods are defined which are all created in the recent century and it means the risk and risk management are rather new concepts. Among the newest tools for measuring the risk is value-at-risk (VaR), which was modified by Morgan (Riskmetrics technical document, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, New York, 1996). VaR represents the maximum expected loss over a certain period of time and at a given confidence level. Many parametric, semi-parametric and nonparametric methods for VaR estimation have been developed. In this article using the mean–variance method one of the parametric techniques of VaR, has been tried to minimize the cost arisen due to locating the supply chain and minimize the maximum level of capital losses, to optimize decision making in the distribution network. The calculated model is tested with numerical examples by MATLAB and Lingo software, and this example supported the resulting model. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In power market environment, the growing importance of demand response (DR) and renewable energy source (RES) attracts more for-profit DR and RES aggregators to compete with each other to maximize their profit. Meanwhile, the intermittent natures of these alternative sources along with the competition add to the probable financial risk of the aggregators. The objective of the paper is to highlight this financial risk of aggregators in such uncertain environment while estimating DR magnitude and power generated by RES. This work develops DR modeling incorporating the effect of estimating power at different confidence levels and uncertain participation of customers. In this paper, two well-known risk assessment techniques, value at risk and conditional value at risk, are applied to predict the power from RES and DR programs at a particular level of risk in different scenarios generated by Monte Carlo method. To establish the linkage between financial risk taking ability of individuals, the aggregators are classified into risk neutral aggregator, risk averse aggregator and risk taking aggregator. The paper uses data from Indian Energy Exchange to produce realistic results and refers certain policies of Indian Energy Exchange to frame mathematical expressions for benefit function considering uncertainties for each type of three aggregators. Extensive results show the importance of assessing the risks involved with two unpredictable variables and possible impacts on technical and financial attributes of the microgrid energy market. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Financial crisis in 2008 caused huge loss and one of the accusations is the misprediction of risk measurement. Considering the important role the stock markets play, and the trend of globalization in economy, we propose forecasting Value at Risk of G20's (except European Union) stock indexes in three periods, pre-crisis, during crisis and post-crisis, via factor copula model. Unlike those models based on multivariate normality, factor copula is based on the assumption that there exists a or several common factors which lead to the change of stock prices. In this paper, different levels of dependence among 19 countries are presented and the results indicate that, during crisis countries with higher values of coefficients tend to have larger loss than others. Also, the large numbers of violations to VaR may be an indicator of the upcoming financial crisis. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We find evidence of a significant positive dependence between the US and Chinese agricultural commodity futures markets. And the empirical results also show that the existence of downside and upside risk spillover effects between variables, especially significant during financial turmoil periods.

abstract={A quantile regression model was built under the smooth transition mechanism with the market volatility index (VIX) as smooth transition variable to study the non-linear effects of the US stock market on most of the global stock markets. The transition position of the smoothing mechanism model can describe the sensitive point of global stock market to the US stock market, and the transition slope describes the conversion rate of interconnectedness. The empirical results show that there does exist nonlinear mechanism transformation in the correlation of international stock markets, and that almost all global stock markets are subject to the impact of the US stock market. Moreover, under different quantiles, the conversion rates between different mechanism are not identical. Evident difference is found under low quantiles, which suggests that the correlation between financial markets is mainly due to tail- risk conduction. Then the collected data was divided into three sub samples and were studied respectively using the proposed model. The results show that there is a significant difference between position parameters during and after the crisis. During the crisis the position parameters decreased, and the correlation improved significantly under low quantiles, indicating that the proposed model is feasible to study the dynamic correlation between financial markets and that the exogenous variable VIX has a considerable influence on the correlation between financial markets. This provides a new perspective for international investors and policy makers to consider the impact of the US economy on global equity markets with the help of the VIX. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of University of Science and Technology of China.

abstract={High-impact, low-probability (HILP) events resulting from extreme weather conditions have a significant impact on the aging power distribution infrastructures. It is of growing concern to minimize the impacts of such catastrophic events on critical infrastructures by appropriately hardening the infrastructure and implementing new operational procedures. This calls for a quantitative assessment of distribution system resilience that can not only predict the impacts of the future events but also be used to evaluate different planning measures taken to minimize the impacts of extreme events. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic metric to quantify the operational resilience of the distribution grid. The metric is based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure where resilience is defined as the conditional expectation of loss of energy in MWh for events beyond a prespecified risk threshold. A simulation-based framework to evaluate the proposed metric for resilience under different weather scenarios is presented. The impacts of restorative actions, specifically using distributed generators and remote-controlled switches (RCS) and the impacts of infrastructure hardening on resilience metric is also investigated. Numerical simulations are performed on the IEEE 123-bus test system. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Value at Risk (VaR) is a measure of risk value by estimating the potential of maximum loss that might occur in future in certain time and a certain level of confidence. The risks faced in agriculture might be in production and marketing of agricultural products. This research aims to estimate the risk value in agricultural commodity-particularly dried shelled corn. Data used was the monthly data of the price of producers in Grobogan in period of November 2015 to July 2018. The data showed the return with the normally undistributed value of skewness and kurtosis. For this, the method of Cornish-Fisher was used in this research to measure the VaR in return that was normally undistributed. At the confidence level of 95%, with the initial capital of 1 million Rupiah, the risk that probably occurred in the following month (1 period) was by Rp 369,173.40 without considering the skewness and kurtosis, and by Rp 22,439.13 by considering skewness and kurtosis. The result of the research showed that, for the return that was normally undistributed, the level of risk obtained from the measurement of VaR by concerning skewness and kurtosis was found more accurate compared to the one without considering the skewness and kurtosis. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper aims to assess the weather risk exposure of Indian power sector from both generation and demand sides. The study considers two representative firms – firstly, Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), a hydro-generator, to assess its rainfall exposure, and secondly, Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC), a retail power supplier, to assess the temperature sensitivity of power demand. The study opts for ‘Value at Risk’ approach, which combines both the sensitivity of power variables towards weather variable and the probability of weather change. The sensitivity is measured using regression analysis with autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL). Parametric distributions are fitted to weather data to assess probabilities. Due to the ‘fat-tail’ characteristic of the fitted distribution, a ‘conditional value-at-risk’ model is considered more effective. The study reveals that the hydroelectricity generation is highly exposed to monsoon rainfall fluctuation and hence the hydro-generator may experience substantial loss of revenue due to insufficient monsoon, whereas the revenue of retail power distributor is moderately exposed to fluctuation of daily surface temperature. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={With the promoting of residential Microgrids and transactive energy system, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transactive mechanism among small household entities have emerged, which allows residents to actively trade energy with their neighbors has appeared in the residential Microgrid. In order to ensure the success of this trading mode, designing an effective bidding strategy in the P2P energy trading has been a hot topic in recent studies. However, in current studies, limitation still exsited such as lack of flexibility and unfair constraints on trading. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a two-stage bidding strategy in the residential Microgrid. In this mechanism, the equilibrim among fair competition in market, economic benefits in participants, and self-sufficiency in Mircogird is achieved. Besides, aiming to help residents make better decisions about their through bidding process, a trading price predictor and a tool for risk analysis, 'Value at Risk' (VaR) are also offered in this process. Moreover, case studies with multiple households involved in a residential Microgrid verifed the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The availability of resources is crucial for the socio-economic stability of our society. For more than two decades, there was a debate on how to structure this issue within the context of life-Cycle assessment (LCA). The classical approach with LCA is to describe "scarcity" for future generations (100-1000 years) in terms of absolute depletion. The problem, however, is that the long-term availability is simply not known (within a factor of 100-1000). Outside the LCA community, the short-term supply risks (10-30 years) were predicted, resulting in the list of critical raw materials (CRM) of the European Union (EU), and the British risk list. The methodology used, however, cannot easily be transposed and applied into LCA calculations. This paper presents a new approach to the issue of short-term material supply shortages, based on subsequent sudden price jumps, which can lead to socio-economic instability. The basic approach is that each resource is characterized by its own specific supply chain with its specific price volatility. The eco-costs of material scarcity are derived from the so-called value at risk (VAR), a well-known statistical risk indicator in the financial world. This paper provides a list of indicators for 42 metals. An advantage of the system is that it is directly related to business risks, and is relatively easy to understand. A disadvantage is that "statistics of the past" might not be replicated in the future (e.g., when changing from structural oversupply to overdemand, or vice versa, which appeared an issue for two companion metals over the last 30 years). Further research is recommended to improve the statistics. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Irrigation-induced landslides with long runout distances endanger local communities. Estimating runout distance of landslides may contribute to the mitigation of potential hazards. Conventional mechanism-related methods require a series of experiments and/or numerical simulations that are commonly time-consuming and expensive, yet data-driven models reduce the experimental workload and require less prior knowledge in the geological history as well as mechanical behavior of the material. A data-driven model is proposed to forecast landslide runout distance using geometrical characteristics of the landslide. The geometrical dataset of the shallow loess landslides and loess-bedrock landslides occurred in Heifangtai terrace, China, was employed to develop the model. All geometrical datasets were obtained from field investigation and monitoring. Seven data-mining techniques were used and compared for runout estimation, among which the most optimal technique was integrated in the estimation model for loess slope failures. The multi-layer perceptron method outperforms other algorithms, and thus it was selected for the runout distance estimation model. Parametric models are constructed to fit runout distance based on the estimation. Hazard analysis measurements, including value-at-risk (VaR) and tail-value-at-risk (TVaR), are computed for the parametric distributions, which shows the potential area of impact and number of residential clusters at risk. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Key message: Economic consequences of altered survival probabilities under climate change should be considered for regeneration planning in Southeast Germany. Findings suggest that species compositions of mixed stands obtained from continuous optimization may buffer but not completely mitigate economic consequences. Mixed stands of Norway spruce (Picea abiesL. Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvaticaL.) (considering biophysical interactions between tree species) were found to be more robust, against both perturbations in survival probabilities and economic input variables, compared to block mixtures (excluding biophysical interactions). Context: Climate change is expected to increase natural hazards in European forests. Uncertainty in expected tree mortality and resulting potential economic consequences complicate regeneration decisions. Aims: This study aims to analyze the economic consequences of altered survival probabilities for mixing Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) under different climate change scenarios. We investigate whether management strategies such as species selection and type of mixture (mixed stands vs. block mixture) could mitigate adverse financial effects of climate change. Methods: The bio-economic modelling approach combines a parametric survival model with modern portfolio theory. We estimate the economically optimal species mix under climate change, accounting for the biophysical and economic effects of tree mixtures. The approach is demonstrated using an example from Southeast Germany. Results: The optimal tree species mixtures under simulated climate change effects could buffer but not completely mitigate undesirable economic consequences. Even under optimally mixed forest stands, the risk-adjusted economic value decreased by 28%. Mixed stands economically outperform block mixtures for all climate scenarios. Conclusion: Our results underline the importance of mixed stands to mitigate the economic consequences of climate change. Mechanistic bio-economic models help to understand consequences of uncertain input variables and to design purposeful adaptation strategies. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With increase of wind power penetration rate in power system, the influence of wind power output uncertainty on evolution path of power system cascading outage cannot be ignored. Based on this, this paper proposes a high risk fault chain model, and uses stochastic power flow and value at risk theory to analyze the risk level of cascading outages. Firstly, during fault chain forecasting, the follow-up fault search indicators combining real-time failure probability and fault consequence are constructed based on stochastic power flow considering correlation of wind power. Subsequent faults are selected according to the values at risk of these indicators. Secondly, in order to reflect the impact of wind power randomness on risk indicators, fuzzy clustering is used to establish wind power scenarios, then system loss of a load risk indicator is calculated. Based on the indicator, it can be analyzed whether current operating point is in a safe or a high-risk area, thereby guiding the system intraday scheduling. Finally, the improved IEEE 39-node system is taken as an example to illustrate rationality of the proposed model and algorithm. And the influence of wind power penetration rate and wind power forecasting error on the risk of cascading outages are analyzed. © 2019, Power System Technology Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={International oil and gas projects feature high capital-intensity, high risks and contract diversity. Therefore, in order to help decision makers make more reasonable decisions under uncertainty, it is necessary to measure the risks of international oil and gas projects. For this purpose, this paper constructs a probabilistic model that is based on the traditional economic evaluation model, and introduces value at risk (VaR) which is a valuable risk measure tool in finance, and applies VaR to measure the risks of royalty contracts, production share contracts and service contracts of an international oil and gas project. Besides, this paper compares the influences of different risk factors on the net present value (NPV) of the project by using the simulation results. The results indicate: (1) risks have great impacts on the project’s NPV, therefore, if risks are overlooked, the decision may be wrong. (2) A simulation method is applied to simulate the stochastic distribution of risk factors in the probabilistic model. Therefore, the probability is related to the project’s NPV, overcoming the inherent limitation of the traditional economic evaluation method. (3) VaR is a straightforward risk measure tool, and can be applied to evaluate the risks of international oil and gas projects. It is helpful for decision making. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={In this work, we show that the entropic value at risk (EVaR), which is not a dynamic risk measure in general, can be a finitely-valued dynamic risk measure for at least one scenario. Specifically, for any distribution where the moment generating function (mgf) exists, then there exists a confidence parameter such that EVaR can be a finitely-valued dynamic risk measure. This separates EVaR from other risk measures, such as the value at risk (VaR), which may not be a finitely-valued dynamic risk for any allowable constant confidence parameter value. This result is not unique to EVaR, as we also show that there exists a confidence parameter such that the average value at risk (AVaR)–which does not require the mgf to exist–is also a finite dynamic risk measure. The main focus of this work is EVaR as it has a stronger stochastic ordering guarantee than AVaR. Future work will examine whether EVaR can be a dynamic risk measure for any other cases. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A confidence interval based distributionally robust real-time dispatch (CI-DRTD) approach considering wind power uncertainty is proposed, which can strike a balance between the operational costs and risk even when the wind power probability distribution cannot be precisely estimated. Based on the imprecise probability theory, the confidence interval based ambiguity set of wind power uncertainty can be constructed. By the identification of the worst distribution, the original distributionally robust optimization problem can be reformulated as a robust economic dispatch problem. By using the algorithm developed in our previous work, the robust economic dispatch model can be reformulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem, for which off-the-shelf solvers are available. Case studies verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract={With the promoting of residential microgrids, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading market among small household entities have emerged. In order to improve the flexibility of transactions and financial benefits for each participants, game-theoretic approaches have been widely investigated in recent studies. However, in current studies, these approaches still have some problems, such as the limitation of the number of participants and some unfair constraints on trade. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a simultaneous game-theoretic approach in the P2P energy trading. Proposed approach overcame the limits on participants' number in this approach, and gives all participants equal rights to decide their trading prices for maximizing their own benefits. Besides, aiming to mitigate a potential risk of transaction failure in the simultaneous game-theoretic approach, a tool for risk analysis, "Value at Risk" (VaR), is also implemented into this approach. Through the VaR, participants could control their trading prices in a reasonable range to ensure successful energy trading. Moreover, case studies with multiple households involved in a residential microgrid confirm the effectiveness of the risk implemented simultaneous game-theoretic approach. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={The elastic load on demand side can change with the fluctuation electricity price, so it could be modeled as the adjustable load cluster and involved into power dispatching with traditional generation unit, which can improve the flexibility of the power system. Due to the influence of various factors, such as the response to electricity price is not timely, signal transmission delay, the user's habits is difficult to be changed, and the response amount and expected value always exist in a certain range of deviation. In this paper, the value at risk (VaR) is used to measure the risk loss caused by the uncertainty of the load cluster response, then VaR is introduced as a loss measure to participate in the optimization of the power dispatching model and establish a joint scheduling model. Through the actual example analysis, the results show that, due to the risk loss of the adjustable load cluster is considered, the risk loss caused by uncertainty response is reduced. The research has practical application prospect to the implementation of DSM projects. © 2018 IEEE},

abstract={Utilizing V2G technology, plug-in electric vehicles(PEVs) can behave as mobile energy storage units to participate in power grid operation. Based on the traffic behavior characteristics, the V2G response capability boundaries of PEVs considering time, energy and battery restraint is constructed. Then, the PEVs connected to the grid are divided into two types: responsive/non-responsive. Finally, the Monte Carlo method is used to establish the T-limit V2G response capability forecast models for individual PEV and PEV groups respectively. On the other side, the value-at-risk(VaR) method is introduced to energy storage capacity sizing, based on which, a reliability-at-risk(RaR) model is built to calculate the conventional storage capacity under a certain confidence level of power system reliability . Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the methods proposed above are proved in the examples. © 2018 IEEE},

abstract={The article discusses the formation of the system of risk management and evaluation of the effectiveness of integrated project risk management in the space rocket sector. The classification of the integrated project risks for knowledge-based enterprise in the space rocket sector and credit institution was made. The main methods of project risks evaluation, which can be applied in the space rocket sector, are described. The scheme of integrated project risk management was made on the basis of the life cycle approach when implementing projects in the space rocket sector. When implementing project risks in the space rocket sector, an enlarged scheme of the Regulations on Integrated Project Risk Management System, was developed. An issue of integrated risk management in the space rocket sector using a system of measures being named the "Value-at-Risk" (VaR) was reviewed. It was concluded that there was a need for project implementation in the space rocket sector using a complex, effective, and integrated system of risk management. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

abstract={Research on the dynamics of landslide displacement forms the basis for landslide hazard prevention. This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach to monitor and predict the landslide displacement. In the first part, autoregressive moving average time series models are constructed to analyze the autocorrelation of landslide triggering factors. A linear ensemble-based extreme learning machine using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is applied in predicting the displacement of landslides. Five benchmarking data-driven models, the support vector machine, neural network, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and the classical extreme learning machine, are considered as baseline models for validating the ensemble-based extreme learning machines. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the proposed prediction model produces the smallest prediction errors among all the algorithms tested. In the second part, parametric copula models are fitted on the predicted displacement, to investigate the relationship between the triggering factors and landslide displacement values. The Gumbel-Hougaard copula model performs best, which indicates strong upper tail correlation between the triggering factors and displacement values. Thresholds for the triggering factors can be obtained by monitoring the landslide moving patterns with large displacement values. The effectiveness and utility of the proposed data-driven approach have been confirmed with the landslide case study in the region of the Three Gorges Reservoir. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In this paper, we performed the Genetic Algorithm within problems of quadratic investment portfolio without a risk-free asset under Value-at-Risk. The limitation of this study is that the risk of an investment portfolio measured by Value-at-Risk, and each investor has the nature of risk aversion. To solve these problems: First, we established the mean vector and covariance matrix. The second step was to define the vector mean and covariance matrices for the formulation of Value-at-Risk of the investment portfolio. Third, using the mean vector and Value-at-Risk established the model. To complete the optimization problem, we performed the Genetic Algorithm. The results show that the trade-off between risk and expected return does not only depend on the type of investor but also on the size of the investment. The Genetic Algorithm certifies us the robust solution in the optimization problem because of its natural ability to locate the global minimal. Moreover, genetic algorithm can be used as an effective way in numerical completion of the optimization of quadratic investment portfolio. In a realistic investment situation, it has likely more constraints. For example, the restriction on short-selling, is need to be considered. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Market risk is the effect generated by the change in market prices. In the case of equity investment portfolios, the change in stock prices generates an expected loss, this expected loss is called Value at Risk (VaR). One way to reduce market risk in investment portfolios is through diversification. This paper proposes the international diversification of portfolios, which is more effective than diversification, through ETFs on international indices of the main stock exchanges of the world. The way to determine the benefits of international diversification of portfolios is done with the VaR calculation by several methodologies. The results show that for investment portfolios from the perspective of investor in Colombia, the market risk with international assets decreases more than with national assets. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={This study analyses the effect of adding bitcoin into the portfolio by exploiting the Long Only investment strategy. The Portfolio consists of five assets: bitcoin, crude oil price index, stock exchange of Thailand (SET) price index, the exchange rate between Thai and USD and Thai government bond compound with treasurer bill. The model used for modelling the return of all asset is Multivariate t-copula based on GARCH and also measure the risk of the portfolio using the Value-at-risk (VaR) under the condition of minimizing the variance of return. We find that when adding more bitcoin into the portfolio, the return and risk of asset increased. If we only invest in bitcoin, we will face the risk at 16.90% and gain 6.27%. When comparing the effectiveness of portfolio by using Return-risk ratio, it found that portfolio with bitcoin shows the higher return rate than portfolios without bitcoin. Therefore, it can conclude that bitcoin could indeed increase the effectiveness of portfolio. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Generally, the risk level of an investment is directly correlated with the returns to be earned by investors in the future. In current situation, it is difficult for investors, shareholders and financial managers to determine the total loss of their asset portfolio because standard deviation is insufficient to describe the actual total loss. Therefore, this research discuss on the concept of Value at Risk (VaR) which has been proven as one of the risk measurement instrument that is effective in describing the total loss of investment in exact currency that will be bear by the investors. VaR is defined as the maximum potential loss in a value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval in normal market condition. The three approaches which are Delta Normal, Historical Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation are used to calculate VaR for a hypothetical portfolio of a stock. The study finally shows that Monte Carlo Simulation approach is the most applicable and flexible in measuring Value at Risk as compared to the other two methods. © 2018 Author(s).},

abstract={Aming at the problem that the market power risk is difficult to be considered in the traditional AGC(Automatic Generation Control) optimization model,the VaR(Value at Risk) for measuring market risk is introduced,and the AGC optimization model of mixed integer nonlinear programming under the constraint of ancillary service cost with VaR as the limit value is constructed. For dealing with the nonlinearity of the model,the two-state auxiliary variables are introduced to equivalently transform the three-state variables of the unit,which realizes the linearization of the model and thus effectively reduces the difficulty of solving the model. Taking the operation data of Guangxi Power Grid as an example,the performances of AGC under different risk confidence levels are compared. The results show that the higher the confidence level is,the greater the regulation cost will be,but with better control effect. However,whether the confidence level is high or not,the proposed model can ensure the CPS(Control Performance Standard) qualification,verifying the validity of the model. It can provide a useful reference for the AGC in the power market environment. © 2018, Electric Power Automation Equipment Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, the concept of value at risk (VAR) is introduced to study process economics related to biodiesel production and use. Although the VAR concept is actively used in financial engineering for stock investment and trading, it has never been used in process economics. A methodology to develop a VAR model for a biodiesel process facility has been proposed and analysed. The impact of different cost related risk factors is modelled using a stochastic process and interdependence in a Bayesian Network format. The analysis reveals that cost underestimation is the most significant risk factor in biodiesel economics. The VAR model is analysed for 1, 5, and 10 VAR for 5 years of plant operations. Analysing VAR at any point of time (i.e. year 2) shows that with a 1% chance, 5% chance and 10% chance, the maximum loss would be $6.26, $9.52 and $11.34 million respectively (up to year 2). When VAR is considered in the process economics the return period is significantly affected and is increased by 21 months. This study recommends that VAR should be considered as an integral part of process economics, especially for new product or process design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Value at Risk (VaR) is one of the statistical methods used to measure market risk by estimating the worst losses in a given time period and level of confidence. The accuracy of this measuring tool is very important in determining the amount of capital that must be provided by the company to cope with possible losses. Because there is a greater losses to be faced with a certain degree of probability by the greater risk. Based on this, VaR calculation analysis is of particular concern to researchers and practitioners of the stock market to be developed, thus getting more accurate measurement estimates. In this research, risk analysis of stocks in four banking sub-sector, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Bank Mandiri, Bank Central Asia and Bank Negara Indonesia will be done. Stock returns are expected to be influenced by exogenous variables, namely ICI and exchange rate. Therefore, in this research, stock risk estimation are done by using VaR ARMAX-GARCHX method. Calculating the VaR value with the ARMAX-GARCHX approach using window 500 gives more accurate results. Overall, Bank Central Asia is the only bank had the estimated maximum loss in the 5% quantile. © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This paper focuses on an investment decision-making process for sustainable development based on the profitability impact factors for overseas projects. Investors prefer to use the discounted cash-flow method. Although this method is simple and straightforward, its critical weakness is its inability to reflect the factor volatility associated with the project evaluation. To overcome this weakness, the Value-at-Risk method is used to apply the volatility of the profitability impact factors, thereby reflecting the risks and establishing decision-making criteria for risk-averse investors. Risk-averse investors can lose relatively acceptable investment opportunities to risk-neutral or risk-amenable investors due to strict investment decision-making criteria. To overcome this problem, critical factors are selected through a Monte Carlo simulation and a sensitivity analysis, and solutions to the critical-factor problems are then found by using the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving and a business version of the Project Definition Rating Index. This study examines the process of recovering investment opportunities with projects that are investment feasible and that have been rejected when applying the criterion of the Value-at-Risk method. To do this, a probabilistic alternative approach is taken. To validate this methodology, the proposed framework for an improved decision-making process is demonstrated using two actual overseas projects of a Korean steel-making company. © 2018 by the authors.},

The activity was greeted enthusiastically by Indonesia Stock Exchange by taking out the slogan Let's Save The Stocks. Stock is a form of investment that is expected to benefit in the future despite has risks. Value at Risk (VaR) is a method that can measure how much the risk of a financial investment. Composite Stock Price Indeks is the stock price index used by Indonesia Stock Exchange as stock volatility benchmarks in Indonesia. This study aimed to estimate Value at Risk (VaR) on closing price Composite Price Share Index Stock data on the period 20 September 2016 until 20 September 2017. Box-Pierce test results p value=0.9528 which is greater than a, that shows homoskedasticity. Value at Risk (VaR) with Variance Covariance Method is Rp.3.054.916,07 which means with 99% confindence interval someone who invests Rp.100.000.000,00 will get Rp.3.054.916,07 as a maximum loss. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={This chapter discusses ways to identify, categorize, and assess risks in supply chains. It pays particular attention to the often hidden risks that can lurk deep within global supply chains. Using case studies, the chapter shows how companies assess and prioritize supplier risks, and it explains the underlying factors that give rise to deep-chain risks. The sweep of examples in the chapter shows that companies can model the likelihood and impacts of a wide range of risks to their facilities, suppliers, and logistics infrastructure. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The aim of the article is to present the issue of risk and related management methods, with a particular emphasis on the conditions of investment in energy infrastructure. The work consists of two main parts; the first one is the theoretical analysis of the issue, while the second discusses the application of analysis methods on the example of the investment in an agricultural biogas plant. The article presents the definitions related to the investment risk and its management, with a particular emphasis on the distinction between the risk and uncertainty. In addition, the main risk groups of the energy sector were subjected to an analysis. Then, the basic systematics and the division into particular risk groups were presented and the impact of the diversification of investments in the portfolio on the general level of risk was determined. The sources of uncertainty were discussed with particular attention to the categories of energy investments. The next part of the article presents risk mitigation methods that are part of the integrated risk management process and describes the basic methods supporting the quantification of the risk level and its effects - including the Monte Carlo (MC), Value at risk (VaR), and other methods. Finally, the paper presents the possible application of the methods presented in the theoretical part. The investment in agricultural biogas plant, due to the predictable operation accompanied by an extremely complicated and long-term investment process, was the subject of the analysis. An example of "large drawing analysis" was presented, followed by a Monte Carlo simulation and a VaR value determination. The presented study allows for determining the risk in the case of deviation of financial flows from the assumed values in particular periods and helps in determining the effects of such deviations. The conducted analysis indicates a low investment risk and suggests the ease of similar calculations for other investments. © 2018 Polityka Energetyczna. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new formula to estimate the electricity demand from battery-swapping stations (BSSs) at peak hours, combining parameters of the number of battery-swapping electric scooters (NBSES) and the number of scooters served per BSS. It also presents a novel decision-support analysis for assessing future impact on energy system with an increasing NBSES in Taiwan. The VaR (Value at Risk) values and Monte Carlo method are combined to assess key variables of NBSES and potential benefits. This study finds that the probability for the percentage of operating reserve (OR), R, beyond 6.0 percent is only 86.3% in the past four years. When NBSES reaches 1.28 million, the probability for R beyond 6.0 percent is down to 69.0% and R is 2.9% (95%CI) without considering the storage ability of BSSs. However, R could be higher than 6.0% (95%CI) if considering the storage ability of BSSs. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

We report the results of a qualitative empirical study that correlates academic literature with 14 - I4.0 frameworks and initiatives. We apply the grounded theory approach to synthesise the findings from our literature review, to compare the cyber security frameworks and cyber security quantitative impact assessment models, with the world leading I4.0 technological trends. From the findings, we build a new impact assessment model of IoT cyber risk in Industry 4.0. We therefore advance the efforts of integrating standards and governance into Industry 4.0 and offer a better understanding of economics impact assessment models for I4.0. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

abstract={Risk analysis is one of the most important components of any financial decision and has been a subject of extensive research. We present here a comparative analysis of different methods to calculate value at risk (VaR) in the Indian Market. The models that have been explored are filtered historical simulations, Monte Carlo, historical simulation, and variance–covariance. The implementation was carried out in MATLAB, and the stock indices of NIFTY 50 and BSE SENSEX were used as a representative of the Indian Stock Market. The results obtained were first compared on the basis of time taken to calculate the risk incurred using six different datasets. They were also compared on the basis of whether the actual losses were within the calculated VaRs. A theoretical comparison on the various methods was also performed. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Building renovation projects are mainly affected by not only the design constraints of existing buildings but also various influential factors (e.g., building age, structural stability, site condition). However, conventional estimation methods deal with renovation projects similar to new construction and do not effectively consider potential risk factors. Thus, unexpected problems can make it difficult to proceed with the initial project execution plan. A three-phase framework is proposed for a probabilistic cost estimation process model that reflects the uncertainties of residential building renovation: (1) roughly estimating the cost based on industry means data; (2) converting the estimated costs to probabilistic values to consider the project characteristics; and (3) adjusting the converted probabilistic values according to risk factors. The value at risk of a specific construction can then be calculated to improve the reliability of the cost estimation. The proposed model was applied to a case study to demonstrate its feasibility. The results showed that the distribution of cost estimates reflecting the project characteristics and risk factors could be objectively confirmed at the initial stage. Thus, the method can help facilitate the decision-making process for homeowners, especially those reluctant to choose renovation. © 2018, Architectural Institute of Japan. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Value-at-Risk has already become a standard measurement that must be carried out by the financial institution for both internal interest and regulatory. In this paper, the estimation of Value-at-Risk of some stocks with econometric models approach is analyzed. In this research, we assume that the stock return follows the time series model. To do the estimation of mean value we are using ARMA models, while to estimate the variance value we are using FIGARCH models. Furthermore, the mean value estimator and the variance are used to estimate the Value-at-Risk. The result of the analysis shows that from five stock PRUF, BBRI, MPPA, BMRI, and INDF, the Value-at-Risk obtained are 0.01791, 0.06037, 0.02550, 0.06030, and 0.02585 respectively. Since Value-at-Risk represents the maximum risk size of each stock at a 95% level of significance, then it can be taken into consideration in determining the investment policy on stocks. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Operation and management of wastewater treatment facilities are critical for facility owners because of limited budget and aging equipments. The assets in a facility are huge in number and amount and complicated, which make owners to adopt an asset management system to their facility. In this research, we compared proactive management cost (PMC) and follow-up management cost (FMC) using life cycle cost (LCC) and risk management, which were major part of asset management for the wastewater treatment plant located in South Korea. For this, we developed a method to forecast future maintenance cost of a dewatering facility in a wastewater treatment plant. We also developed a method to obtain average occurrence probability and average occurrence cost using data grouping method with equal width of the valid data of USD 273.0. And then, we predicted cumulated maintenance cost (CMC) and cumulative distribution function (CDF). LCC results of dewatering facility were obtained from maintenance cost data and Bernoulli trials. It was expected that the maintenance cost reaches $234,778 after 385 months from its installation. We calculated value at risk (VaR) using average occurrence probability and repair cost. We calculated PMC and FMC using VaR and LCC. Proactive maintenance was beneficial to facility owners because the maximum difference at 285 months between PMC and FMC was USD 37,530. © 2017 Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Hourly wind power ramps in ERCOT are studied by applying extreme value theory. Mean excess plot reveals that the tail behavior of large hourly wind power ramps indeed follows a generalized Pareto distribution. The location, shape, and scale parameters of generalized Pareto distribution are then determined by using mean excess plot and the least square technique, from which risk measures including α quantile value at risk and conditional value at risk are calculated. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={It is estimated that Europe alone will need to add over 250,000 km of transmission capacity by 2050, if it is to meet renewable energy production goals while maintaining security of supply. Estimating the cost of new transmission infrastructure is difficult, but it is crucial to predict these costs as accurately as possible, given their importance to the energy transition. Transmission capacity expansion plans are often founded on optimistic projections of expansion costs. We present probabilistic predictive models of the cost of submarine power cables, which can be used by policymakers, industry, and academia to better approximate the true cost of transmission expansion plans. The models are both generalizable and well-specified for a variety of submarine applications, across a variety of regions. The best performing statistical learning model has slightly more predictive power than a simpler, linear econometric model. The specific decision context will determine whether the extra data gathering effort for the statistical learning model is worth the additional precision. A case study illustrates that incorporating the uncertainty associated with the cost prediction to calculate risk metrics - value-at-risk and conditional-value-at-risk - provides useful information to the decision-maker about cost variability and extremes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this paper we analyze financial risk from the point of view of a brokerage company, who exposes itself to risk by lending assets or money to its clients for allowing short-selling or leveraged operations (firm-wise risk). We develop analytical models for control of firm-wise risk, by defining both specific margin factors for single assets and a global margin factor that takes into account the overall riskiness of a complex portfolio. In the first part of this work we derive a model to evaluate leverage factors, by linking them with the probability for the client's portfolio value to go below a certain safety threshold, using Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall approaches. Further, we present optimization models based on these two approaches in order to determine the optimal leverage factors. In the second part, we present a model for margin control based on the concept of marginal availability. A global margin factor considering the overall riskiness of a complex portfolio is derived, and we show the effectiveness of the approach also when dealing with portfolios containing options. © 2017},

abstract={Hazardous materials (hazmat) accidents are rare though the consequences could be disastrous. Given the possibility of low probability – high consequence event, a risk-averse routing hazmat shipment is necessary. We propose a value-at-risk (VaR) approach to route rail hazmat shipments, using the best train configuration, over a given railroad network with limited number of train services such that the transport risk as measured by VaR is minimized. Freight train derailment reports of the Federal Railroad Administration were analyzed to develop expressions that would incorporate characteristics of railroad accidents, and then to estimate the different inputs. The proposed methodology was used to study several problem instances generated using the realistic network of a railroad operator, and to demonstrate that it is possible to develop different routes for shipments depending on the risk preference of the decision maker. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Stocks are known as the financial instruments traded in the capital market which have a high level of risk. Their risks are indicated by their uncertainty of their return which have to be accepted by investors in the future. The higher the risk to be faced, the higher the return would be gained. Therefore, the measurements need to be made against the risk. Value at Risk (VaR) as the most popular risk measurement method, is frequently ignore when the pattern of return is not uni-modal Normal. The calculation of the risks using VaR method with the Normal Mixture Autoregressive (MNAR) approach has been considered. This paper proposes VaR method couple with the Mixture Laplace Autoregressive (MLAR) that would be implemented for analysing the first three biggest capitalization Islamic stock return in JII, namely PT. Astra International Tbk (ASII), PT. Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk (TLMK), and PT. Unilever Indonesia Tbk (UNVR).

abstract={This study applies the copula-based Markov process to model water quality time series. The bivariate copula is applied to investigate the first-order Markov processes. The D-Vine copula is applied to investigate the more complicated higher-order (k≥2) Markov processes. The Value-at-Risk (VaR), computed using the best-fitted copula-based Markov process, is applied for the risk analysis. Using water quality time series at the Snohomish River watershed (Washington) and the Chattahoochee River watershed (Georgia), the results show that the copula-based Markov processes (1) are able to properly model the temporal dependence for dissolved oxygen (DO) series [i.e., forecast root-mean-square error (RMSE) <1 mg/L at both watersheds] and temperature (T) series (i.e., forecast RMSE = 1.5°C at the Chattahoochee watershed); and (2) can only predict the overall trend for nitrate and conductivity series, due to the fact that these two series also depend heavily on other factors (e.g., runoff). Overall, the study indicates that the copula-based Markov process may be an efficient tool in the assessment of water quality and the associated risks with the following advantages: (1) constructing the transitional probability explicitly and properly; (2) studying the temporal dependence independently from the marginal distributions; (3) avoiding the strict assumptions of the classic time series modeling approach (e.g., the time series belonging to the Gaussian process); and (4) providing a reasonable risk measure through the VaR. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The study of reservoir deterministic optimal operation can improve the utilization rate of water resource and help the hydropower stations develop more reasonable power generation schedules. However, imprecise forecasting inflow may lead to output error and hinder implementation of power generation schedules. In this paper, output error generated by the uncertainty of the forecasting inflow was regarded as a variable to develop a short-term reservoir optimal operation model for reducing operation risk. To accomplish this, the concept of Value at Risk (VaR) was first applied to present the maximum possible loss of power generation schedules, and then an extreme value theory-genetic algorithm (EVT-GA) was proposed to solve the model. The cascade reservoirs of Yalong River Basin in China were selected as a case study to verify the model, according to the results, different assurance rates of schedules can be derived by the model which can present more flexible options for decision makers, and the highest assurance rate can reach 99%, which is much higher than that without considering output error, 48%. In addition, the model can greatly improve the power generation compared with the original reservoir operation scheme under the same confidence level and risk attitude. Therefore, the model proposed in this paper can significantly improve the effectiveness of power generation schedules and provide a more scientific reference for decision makers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Aquaculture production is increasingly important in seafood production and is currently the fastest growing food production technology worldwide. To continue the industry growth, price risk management is an essential part in creating successful projects and sustainable business operations. This research uses trade data on fish and invertebrate prices, and evaluates the relative price uncertainty from farmed and captured products. Moreover, we consider a set of species groups (fish, invertebrates), species’ families (e.g., Salmonidae, white fish and crustaceans), and individual species (e.g., salmon, seabream and prawns), and evaluate their price volatility over time using Value-at-Risk (VaR). The results indicate that the introduction of aquaculture production to a species’ total supply will reduce price volatility. Consequently, incentives and regulations should support research and development of new aquaculture species. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.},

For the illustration we use data of the company listed on Prague Stock Exchange in range from January 2011 to June 2016. HMM approach allows us to classify time series into different states based on their development characteristic. Due to a deeper shortage of existing domestic results or comparison studies with advanced volatility governed VaR forecasts we tested HMM with univariate ARMA-GARCH model based VaR estimates. The common testing via Kupiec and Christoffersen procedures offer generalization that HMM model performs better that volatility based VaR estimation technique in terms of accuracy, even with the simpler HMM with normal-mixture distribution against previously used GARCH with many types of non-normal innovations. © 2017 Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry Brno.

abstract={Aim of study: To examine methods of incorporating risk and uncertainty to stand level forest decisions. Area of study: A case study examines a small forest holding from Jönköping, Sweden. Material and methods: We incorporate empirically estimated uncertainty into the simulation through a Monte Carlo approach when simulating the forest stands for the next 100 years. For the iterations of the Monte Carlo approach, errors were incorporated into the input data which was simulated according to the Heureka decision support system. Both the Value at Risk and the Conditional Value at Risk of the net present value are evaluated for each simulated stand. Main results: Visual representation of the errors can be used to highlight which decision would be most beneficial dependent on the decision maker’s opinion of the forest inventory results. At a stand level, risk preferences can be rather easily incorporated into the current forest decision support software. Research highlights: Forest management operates under uncertainty and risk. Methods are available to describe this risk in an understandable fashion for the decision maker. © 2017 INIA.},

abstract={This study will discuss the problems of quadratic investment portfolio without a risk-free asset based on value-at-risk. It is assumed that the risk of an investment portfolio measured by value-at-risk. The resolution of problems that do include: first, formulate models the trade-off problem. Secondly, formulate expectation maximization model of the problem. Third, formulate model minimization of value-at-risk problem. Based on the results of the discussions can be concluded that the trade-off between risk and expected return does not only depend on the type of investor but also on the size of the investment. In a realistic investment situation, it is likely that more constraints, e.g., restriction on short-selling, need to be considered. © Medwell Journals, 2017.},

abstract={The types and varieties of peppers grown in Mediterranean areas are a response to the demand of European markets, although in each Autonomous Community local varieties are grown to satisfy the national demand. Nowadays, the range of shapes, colours, tastes and uses is wider than ever as a result of greenhouse cultivation, national and international tendencies and increased demand. In Murcia, the growing cycle runs from December to July or August, depending on the market and the growth of the crop. Sweet pepper is normally grown in greenhouses, using a variety of technologies: from simple shaded greenhouses, to the most-advanced multitunnels (large, in the form of a round arch or Gothic arch and with sophisticated ventilation). Due to the high cost of fuel, it is impossible to use heating during winter after transplanting, so alternative techniques are used to raise the temperature a few degrees and improve crop production. The aim of this work was to increase the precocity and productivity of sweet pepper grown in greenhouses. The effect of a Polypropylene Spunbonded Nonwoven Microtunnel (PSNM) was studied. The results show that, although the increase in production was not great (lower than 5% in both years of the study), precocity increased by 16% in both years. Since the increased cost of using this technology is not excessive, crop profitability increases if precocity is taken into account, as all our indicators show. The study suggests that the use of a PSNM raises the marketable production and brings forward the first harvests. © 2017, Tarbiat Modares University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There are many methods used in determining the performance of a stock. None of them offer the investor a correct risk analysis of their holding and they frequently exposed to a high market risk. However, a sector that is worth investing can also be determined by researching its riskiness in the market. By adapting VaR measurement, this study aims to determine the least risky and the riskiest economic sector for investment in Malaysia. Two approaches used in estimating the VaR for the selected economic sector namely the historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation. Results of the analysis show that the manufacturing sector have been the least risky sector for investment and the riskiest sector is telecommunication sector. The choice of which to invest depends on the risk appetite of investors. Historical simulation being the most appropriate approach to measure value at risk in this particular study as it results a smaller value of mse and made and also based on backtesting using Kupiec's test. © Medwell Journals, 2017.},

The main aim of the study is to effectively measure stock market risks to maintain the healthy development of the stock market by using the GARCH model. The GARCH and Value-at-Risk models are employed to assess and measure stock market risks, respectively. To promote the quality of parameter selection for the GARCH model, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) to estimate optimal parameters is proposed. Experimental results prove that our proposed GA-GARCH model can measure stock market risks with high accuracy.},

abstract={Rapid transit network design is highly dependent on the future system usage. These spatially distributed systems are vulnerable to disruptions: during daily operations different incidents may occur. Despite the unpredictable nature of them, effective mitigation methods from an engineering perspective should be designed. In this paper, we present several risk averse measures for risk reduction in the rapid transit network design problem based on a set of finite scenarios to represent the disruptions' uncertainty. As a counter-parts of the typical risk neutral strategy, some measures that are presented are aiming to minimizing the impacts of the worst scenario in the network operation, and another additionally, takes into account different risk reduction profiles. Some computational experience is presented. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper studies an optimal portfolio selection problem in the presence of the Maximum Value-at-Risk (MVaR) constraint in a hidden Markovian regime-switching environment. The price dynamics of n risky assets are governed by a hidden Markovian regime-switching model with a hidden Markov chain whose states represent the states of an economy. We formulate the problem as a constrained utility maximization problem over a finite time horizon and then reduce it to solving a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation using the separation principle. The MVaR constraint for n risky assets plus one riskless asset is derived and the method of Lagrange multiplier is used to deal with the constraint. A numerical algorithm is then adopted to solve the HJB equation. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the implementation of the algorithm. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed the ever increasing renewable penetration in power generation systems, which entails modern unit commitment problems with modelling and computation burdens. This study aims to simulate the impacts of manifold uncertainties on system operation with emission concerns. First, probability theory and fuzzy set theory are applied to jointly represent the uncertainties such as wind generation, load fluctuation and unit outage that interleaved in unit commitment problems. Second, a Value-at-Risk-based multi-objective approach is developed as a bridge of existing stochastic and robust unit commitment optimizations, which not only captures the inherent conflict between operation cost and supply reliability, but also provides easy-to-adjust robustness against worst-case scenarios. Third, a multi-objective algorithm that integrates fuzzy simulation and particle swarm optimization is developed to achieve approximate Pareto-optimal solutions. The research effectiveness is exemplified by two case studies: The comparison between test systems with and without generation uncertainty demonstrates that this study is practicable and can suggest operational insights of generation mix systems. The sensitivity analysis on Value-at-Risk proves that our method can achieve adequate tradeoff between performance optimality and robustness, thus help system operators in making informed decisions.

abstract={The considerable amount of required infrastructure and renewable energy investments expected in the forthcoming years also implies an increasingly relevant contribution of private and institutional investors. In this context, especially regulatory and policy risks have been shown to play a major role for investors when evaluating investments in renewable energy and should thus also be taken into account in risk assessment and when deriving risk-return profiles. In this paper, we provide a stochastic model framework to quantify policy risks associated with renewable energy investments (e.g. a retrospective reduction of a feed-in tariff), thereby also taking into account energy price risk, resource risk, and inflation risk. The model is illustrated by means of simulations and scenario analyses, and it makes use of expert estimates and fuzzy set theory for quantifying policy risks. Our numerical results for a portfolio of onshore wind farms in Germany and France show that policy risk can strongly impact risk-return profiles, and that cross-country diversification effects can considerably decrease the overall risk for investors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Unit commitment, as one of the most important control processes in power systems, has been studied extensively in the past decades. Usually, the goal of unit commitment is to reduce as much production cost as possible while guaranteeing the power supply operated with a high reliability. However, system operators encounter increasing difficulties to achieve an optimal scheduling due to the challenges in coping with uncertainties that exist in both supply and demand sides. This study develops a day-ahead two-stage multi-objective unit commitment model which optimizes both the supply reliability and the total cost with environmental concerns of thermal generation systems. To tackle the manifold uncertainties of unit commitment in a more comprehensive and realistic manner, stochastic and fuzzy set theories are utilized simultaneously, and a unified reliability measurement is then introduced to evaluate the system reliability under the uncertainties of both sudden unit outage and unforeseen load fluctuation. In addition, a cumulative probabilistic method is proposed to address the spinning reserve optimization during the scheduling. To solve this complicated model, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed. Finally, a series of experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this research; we also justify its feasibility on test systems with generation uncertainty. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Mine planning is a multidisciplinary procedure that aims to guarantee the profitability of a mining operation in changing and uncertain conditions. Mine plans are normally classified as long-term, intermediate-term, and short-term plans, and many factors affect the preciseness of these plans and cause deviations in reaching the objectives. Commodity price is the heart of mine planning, but it has a changing and uncertain nature. Therefore, the determination of mine plans in the presence of uncertain mineral price is a challenge. A robust mine plan reduces the risk of early mine closure. A procedure is presented to determine the value at risk (VaR) in any possible mine planning alternative. VaR is considered together with downside risk and upside potential in order to select the most profitable and least risky plan. The model is tested on a small iron ore deposit. © The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2016.},

abstract={We extend the concept of 'Weather Value at Risk' - initially introduced to measure the economic risks resulting from current weather fluctuations - to describe and compare sectoral income risks from climate change. This is illustrated using the examples of wheat cultivation and summer tourism in (parts of) Sardinia. Based on climate scenario data from four different regional climate models we study the change in the risk of weather-related income losses between some reference (1971-2000) and some future (2041-2070) period. Results from both examples suggest an increase in weather-related risks of income losses due to climate change, which is somewhat more pronounced for summer tourism. Nevertheless, income from wheat cultivation is at much higher risk of weather-related losses than income from summer tourism, both under reference and future climatic conditions. A weather-induced loss of at least 5% - compared to the income associated with average reference weather conditions - shows a 40% (80%) probability of occurrence in the case of wheat cultivation, but only a 0.4% (16%) probability of occurrence in the case of summer tourism, given reference (future) climatic conditions. Whereas in the agricultural example increases in the weather-related income risks mainly result from an overall decrease in average wheat yields, the heightened risk in the tourism example stems mostly from a change in the weather-induced variability of tourism incomes. With the extended 'Weather Value at Risk' concept being able to capture both, impacts from changes in the mean and the variability of the climate, it is a powerful tool for presenting and disseminating the results of climate change impact assessments. Due to its flexibility, the concept can be applied to any economic sector and therefore provides a valuable tool for cross-sectoral comparisons of climate change impacts, but also for the assessment of the costs and benefits of adaptation measures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Tourism represents an important source of income and employment in many Mediterranean regions, including the island of Sardinia (Italy) and the Cap Bon peninsula (Tunisia). Climate change may however impact tourism in both regions, for example, by altering the regions' climatic suitability for common tourism types or affecting water availability. This paper assesses the potential impacts of climate change on tourism in the case study regions of Sardinia and Cap Bon. Direct impacts are studied in a quantitative way by applying a range of climate scenario data on the empirically estimated relationship between climatic conditions and tourism demand, using two different approaches. Results indicate a potential for climate-induced tourism revenue gains especially in the shoulder seasons during spring and autumn, but also a threat of climate-induced revenue losses in the summer months due to increased heat stress. Annual direct net impacts are nevertheless suggested to be (slightly) positive in both case study regions. Significant climate-induced reductions in total available water may however somewhat counteract the positive direct impacts of climate change by putting additional water costs on the tourism industry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this paper, we concentrate on the problem of stock market risk measurement, which is of great importance for the healthy development of the stock market. The main innovations of this paper lie in that 1) we introduce the GARCH model in stock market risk measuring, and 2) we utilize the Value-at-Risk (VaR) as the stock market risk measure. In order to solve the volatility prediction problem, GARCH model is developed to allow for a great more flexible lag structure and VaR is defined as the loss associated with the low percentile of the return distribution. As the performance of the GARCH model highly depends on the parameter selection, we propose an improved genetic algorithm to estimate optimal parameters for the GARCH model. Finally, to test the effectiveness of the proposed GA-GARCH algorithm, we choose Shanghai composite index and Shenzhen Compositional Index to make performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed GA-GARCH model can effectively cover the stock market risk. Copyright © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

abstract={In this paper, a model for analyzing each U.S. Equity sector’s risk contribution (VaR ratio), the ratio of the Value-at-Risk of a sector to the Value-at-Risk of the system (S&P 500 Index), with vine Copula-based ARMA-GARCH (1, 1) modeling is presented. Vine copula modeling not only has the advantage of extending to higher dimensions easily, but also provides a more flexible measure to capture an asymmetric dependence among assets. We investigate systemic risk in 10 S&P 500 sector indices in the U.S. stock market by forecasting one-day ahead VaR and one-day ahead VaR ratio during the 2008 financial subprime crisis. Our evidence reveals vine Copula-based ARMA-GARCH (1, 1) is the appropriate model to forecast and analyze systemic risk. © 2016, International Association of Engineers. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Measurement of market risk requires lots of computational resources when the Value-at-Risk (VaR) is computed using the historical simulation approach as it involves full revaluation of the portfolio for the considered data points. Although approximations can be done using the delta-normal, delta-gamma and delta-gamma-theta approaches, historical simulation approach alone is straight forward method that uses past data to generate future values without assuming any distribution for the underlying returns. The requirement of intensive computational effort in case of historical simulation hinders it's usage for applying to real time VaR calculation. In this work we propose a methodology that doesn't forego the benefits of historical simulation approach but can be applied to calculate market risk VaR in real time. The VaR calculated using the proposed methodology converges as the range of the portfolio returns is increased. The proposed methodology is also superior to the historical simulation approach in terms of usage of the computational resources and applicability to real time without sacrificing accuracy obtained using historical simulation approach.},

abstract={Risk and reliability have a significant connection in meaning; both of them are the facts for one inference. High level of risk is resource of lower reliability. Risk management in power system has a variety of different subjects including models, methods and applications. Risk is a mixture of probability of disturbance event and the negative effect of that occurrence. Usually it counted for random accident which has harmful effect on people's life and environment. In this paper risks study of storm situation modelled. Random failures in power system are the origin of risk and cannot control by staff. Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) has used to model the fault frequencies and outage time of customers. The two tools which use in financial studies to make investment decision and applicable in power systems are Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) Result of study compared to the actual reliability which confirm the improvement in the reliability of system. It is not possible to predict the precise amount of load value, Concerns of power outage in local area and possibility of a general blackout. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Distributed Generation (DG) has received increasing attention during the last decade. Advantage and constraints of DG application are well known to both DG owner and electric utility. Various technologies are available for DG units among them gas GenSet is, in particular, more attractive to the investors as the technology provides the control on DG generation. However, there are various financial risks associated with dispatchable DG units that prohibit wide private investment in such technologies. This paper examines the use of financial tools to manage dispatchable DG economic risks. A comprehensive framework has been proposed to consider various economic risks to DG owner. Suitable models have been used to incorporate risk management tools, in particular the financial tools, in the problem. Optimal use of risk management tools has been determined based on conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) approach. The proposed approach has been applied to a test case and the effectiveness of the solution has been verified. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Current cost allocation methods require generating companies (GENCOs) to afford spinning reserve (SR) costs according to their energy production rather than the impact on grid stabilization. The differences in generator reliability and forecast accuracy of renewables cause difficulty in quantifying the contribution of individual factors on the SR requirements (SRRs). First, this paper employs a reliability-constrained unit commitment (RCUC) model to determine the SRR and SR costs according to the grid reliability. Then, a cost allocation method is proposed to allocate these SR costs based on risk contribution theories. The risk contribution theories, marginal contribution, and stand-alone contribution are employed to measure the effect of individual risk factors on grid safety. The cost allocation method is demonstrated and discussed in the IEEE-RTS. The proposed risk contribution method can quantify the impacts of risk factors on grid safety and allocate SR costs into them according to their contributions. Additionally, this risk-based cost allocation method can encourage GENCOs to enhance the reliability level of generators and continuously improve the forecast accuracy of renewables to lower SR costs. © 2015 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

abstract={The traditional method of net present value (NPV) to analyze the economic profitability of an investment (based on a deterministic approach) does not adequately represent the implicit risk associated with different but correlated input variables. Using a stochastic simulation approach for evaluating the profitability of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) production in Chile, the objective of this study is to illustrate the complexity of including risk in economic feasibility analysis when the project is subject to several but correlated risks. The results of the simulation analysis suggest that the non-inclusion of the intratemporal correlation between input variables underestimate the risk associated with investment decisions. The methodological contribution of this study illustrates the complexity of the interrelationships between uncertain variables and their impact on the convenience of carrying out this type of business in Chile. The steps for the analysis of economic viability were: First, adjusted probability distributions for stochastic input variables (SIV) were simulated and validated. Second, the random values of SIV were used to calculate random values of variables such as production, revenues, costs, depreciation, taxes and net cash flows. Third, the complete stochastic model was simulated with 10,000 iterations using random values for SIV. This result gave information to estimate the probability distributions of the stochastic output variables (SOV) such as the net present value, internal rate of return, value at risk, average cost of production, contribution margin and return on capital. Fourth, the complete stochastic model simulation results were used to analyze alternative scenarios and provide the results to decision makers in the form of probabilities, probability distributions, and for the SOV probabilistic forecasts. The main conclusion shown that this project is a profitable alternative investment in fruit trees in Chile. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Fruticultura. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The engineering method of energy storage sizing and the operation and management of electric vehicles (EVs) were studied considering the moving load and storage characteristics of EVs in microgrids. The value at risk (VaR) theory was applied to evaluating the risk of the configured storage. Three EV regional energy management modes including uncoordinated charging, coordinated charging and coordinated charging/discharging were formulated utilizing a price incentive model. The optimal storage size was calculated by minimizing the comprehensive cost of microgrid in a day in grid-connected mode. The impacts of interactive power penalty coefficient and fluctuation on selecting storage size were also analyzed. VaR theory was applied to analyzing the islanded operation risk in various energy managements and the feasibility of the configured storage size was verified. The simulation result validates that compared with uncoordinated charging mode, coordinated charging and coordinated charging /discharging modes reduces storage size, lowers the comprehensive cost and decreased the fluctuation of interactive power. Compared with no EV participating in islanded microgrid, the length of islanded time is extended and the risk of autonomous islanded operation is decreased significantly when encouraging EV to discharge. © 2015 Chin.

abstract={In this article, we study a Stochastic Minimum Cost Flow (SMCF) problem under arc failure uncertainty, where an arc flow solution may correspond to multiple path flow representations. We assume that the failure of an arc will cause flow losses on all paths using that arc, and for any path carrying positive flows, the failure of any arc on the path will lose all flows carried by the path. We formulate two SMCF variants to minimize the cost of arc flows, while respectively restricting the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of random path flow losses due to uncertain arc failure (reflected as network topological changes). We formulate a linear program to compute possible losses, yielding a mixed-integer programming formulation of SMCF-VaR and a linear programming formulation of SMCF-CVaR. We present a kidney exchange problem under uncertain match failure as an application and use the two SMCF models to maximize the utility/social welfare of pairing kidneys subject to constrained risk of utility losses. Our results show the efficacy of our approaches, the conservatism of using CVaR, and optimal flow patterns given by VaR and CVaR models on diverse instances. Copyright © "IIE" 2015.},

abstract={The research presented in the study is the analysis and implementation of parametric and non-parametric Value at Risk (VaR) calculation models for predicting risk and determining the maximum potential loss from investment activities. The study sample includes stock indices of Serbian (BELEX15), Hungarian (BUX), Croatian (CROBEX) and Slovenian (SBITOP) markets, from 1st January 2006 to 31st December 2012. The methodology connotes the use of analysis and synthesis, as well as relevant statistical and mathematical methods. The study is based on the assumption that there is no statistically significant difference among the different models of risk management, in relation to the performance of investment risk prediction in the markets of the observed transition economies. The main aim of the study is to assess the performances of risk management models in practice, in order to operationally optimize investment decisions. The research results indicate the implementation adequacy of the tested models in the observed transitional markets, with full consideration of their specifics. © 2015, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

A dynamic value-at-risk portfolio method is proposed, and the risk criterion is composed by unexpected short-term risks which occur suddenly in each period. Analytical solutions for the VaR portfolio problem are obtained at each period. By dynamic programming approach, we derive an optimality condition for the optimal value-at-risk portfolio in a decision process. It is shown that a dynamic optimal value-at-risk is a solution of the optimality equation under a reasonable assumption, and an optimal trading strategy is obtained from the equation. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The commonly used tool for measuring risk of a portfolio with equally weighted stocks is variance-covariance method. Under extreme circumstances, this method leads to significant underestimation of actual risk due to its multivariate normality assumption of the joint distribution of stocks. The purpose of this research is to compare the actual risk of portfolio with the simulated risk of portfolio in which the joint distribution of two return series is predetermined. The data used is daily stock prices from the ASEAN market for the period January 2000 to December 2012. The copula approach is applied to capture the time varying dependence among the return series. The results shows that the chosen copula families are not suitable to present the dependence structures of each bivariate returns. Exception for the Philippines-Thailand pair where by t copula distribution appears to be the appropriate choice to depict its dependence. Assuming that the t copula distribution is the joint distribution of each paired series, simulated returns is generated and value-at-risk (VaR) is then applied to evaluate the risk of each portfolio consisting of two simulated return series. The VaR estimates was found to be symmetrical due to the simulation of returns via elliptical copula-GARCH approach. By comparison, it is found that the actual risks are underestimated for all pairs of portfolios except for Philippines-Thailand. This study was able to show that disregard of the non-normal dependence structure of two series will result underestimation of actual risk of the portfolio. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={The article points out the possibilities of using static D-Vine copula ARMA-GARCH model for estimation of 1 day ahead market Value at Risk. For the illustration we use data of the four companies listed on Prague Stock Exchange in range from 2010 to 2014. Vine copula approach allows us to construct high-dimensional copula from both elliptical and Archimedean bivariate copulas, i.e. multivariate probability distribution, created from process innovations. Due to a deeper shortage of existing domestic results or comparison studies with advanced volatility governed VaR forecasts we backtested D-Vine copula ARMA-GARCH model against the VaR rolling out of sample forecast from October 2012 to April 2014 of chosen benchmark models, e.g. multivariate VAR-GO-GARCH, VAR-DCC-GARCH and univariate ARMA-GARCH type models. Common backtesting via Kupiec and Christoffersen procedures offer generalization that technological superiority of model supports accuracy only in case of an univariate modeling - working with non-basic GARCH models and innovations with leptokurtic distributions. Multivariate VAR governed type models and static Copula Vines performed in stated backtesting comparison worse than selected univariate ARMA-GARCH, i.e. it have overestimated the level of actual market risk, probably due to hardly tractable time-varying dependence structure.},

abstract={This paper presents a framework for addressing uncertainty and risk for large-scale transportation investments involving public–private participation. Demand, fare/toll and demand responsive costs are considered in the uncertainty analysis. Uncertainty analysis provides information on economic feasibility of the project. A set of relaxation policies is proposed to form various Ownership, Tenure and Governance (OTG) strategies reflecting the nature and level of participation by the public and private entity. A Monte Carlo Simulation-based Value at Risk is used to quantify risk. Finally, a methodology is proposed to integrate uncertainty and risk. The framework is tested on the proposed multibillion dollar Detroit River International Crossing connecting the cities of Detroit in the USA with Windsor in Canada. The analysis provides insights to probable outcomes for this transportation infrastructure investment under different OTG scenarios. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={We present our work on computing the value at risk (VaR) of a large hypothetical portfolio in the OpenCL programming model on an AMD FirePro V7900 graphics processing unit (GPU). In the computation of the VaR we follow the delta-gamma Monte Carlo approach. The value change of the portfolio within a short time period is approximated by the sum of a linear delta component and a non-linear gamma component. To approximate the distribution of the value change of the portfolio we generate a large number scenarios. From each scenario a loss or gain of the portfolio is calculated by the delta-gamma approximation. All these potential losses and gains are then sorted, from which an appropriate percentile is chosen as the VaR. We implemented this algorithm in OpenCL. The details are discussed and the experimental results are reported. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.},

abstract={The developed method of risk-based asset replacement consists of the three major parts: availability & reliability calculations, asset risk determination with a Value at Risk (VaR) method and the multiple choice knapsack optimized replacement strategy developer. The transmission network availability & reliability calculations are carried out with multiple load flow scenarios which cover all typical load states during a year of the investigated transmission system. The developed VaR-method includes a Monte Carlo simulation to generate and concentrate an amount of input values to one key figure per asset. The individual outage rates and costs which depend on the time of failure occurrence are taken into account by the VaR determination. The multiple choice knapsack optimized risk-based replacement strategy developer determines the decision which activity is chosen for the individual asset and the reliability & availability of the overall transmission network and minimum investment costs as target figures. This two-dimensional optimum is found with the branch-and-bound algorithm of Sinha and Zolters. The three different opportunities are immediately replacement, refurbishment or inspection with a change to a corrective replacement. The transition from a standard to a risk-based replacement strategy allows a significant budget reduction while keeping transmission system reliability & availability. The assets providing an increased risk in the network due to their age-related behavior and location in the transmission network are determined and get a higher priority for exchange. Thus, the major assets are replaced more quickly and due to the corrective replacement strategy the costs are reduced for the less important assets. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are extensively used to assess risk in mining ventures; however, the correlation between the inputs used to build the models is often overlooked. We observed how value-at-risk (VaR) of a mining venture was affected by running MC simulations, using two different input correlation methods: Spearman's rank correlation and copulas using Kendall's tau. The goal was to compare different correlation approaches on risk analysis associated with uncertain parameters of mining ventures and uncover which one would yield the most accurate result. Three case studies were carried out to compare correlation structures. Modelling the input variable correlations was better achieved using copulas since they were able to capture a wider range of correlations that did not make any linearity assumptions. In the case study based on MC simulations, the impact of the input correlation choice on the VaR was rather severe with an approximate 9% difference between the results obtained with Spearman's correlations and the Normal copula correlations. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This paper aims at comparing particle swarm optimization (PSO) with genetic algorithm (GA) for portfolio management in a constrained portfolio optimization problem in which short selling is not permitted. The minimized objective function is value-at-risk calculated by using historical simulation. The tests results reveal that these methods are able to calculate consistently the optimized solutions within a proper time. With respect to the statistical calculations, it is concluded that these algorithms do not lead to a best solution identically. In terms of time of implementation and number of iterations, particle swarm optimization seems to reach more swiftly to the solution compared with genetic algorithm; and in terms of sensitivity to the initial position of the particles, particle swarm optimization is more leading than genetic algorithm. Among other findings of this paper is that 50 particles (chromosomes) are sufficient for problems with up to 20 assets.},

In practice, value-at-risk (VaR), as a risk management technique, was widely used. This paper reviews the price risk measurement in electricity market based on VaR, which includes non-parametric, parametric and semi-parametric method. We put great emphasis on the analysis of parametric model based on GARCH and "Realized Volatility", and semi-parametric model based on extreme value theory. Semi-parametric model combines the advantages of non-parametric and parameter method, improves the accuracy of the VaR calculation, while the determination of the threshold needs further study.},

abstract={The amount of digital data has rapidly increased at a rate of double per year since 2009. Adopting cloud computing storage services will consequently be an alternative approach to gain cost flexibility. Data encryption and access control are common data protection methods in cloud storages. However, traditional full data encryption in clouds can ensure privacy preserving but cause the low analysis efficiency problem. The emerging requirements of data analysis in clouds are balanced between data security and data analysis capacity. An efficient data protection scheme in hybrid clouds is proposed to improve data protection efficiency, rise up data availability and decrease the maintenance cost of cloud services. Data classification and selective data protection mechanisms are two key phases in this paper. According to the functional analysis and comparison results, The proposed scheme is therefore more suitable for efficiency data protection in hybrid clouds than traditional methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={The deregulation in electric power industry has heightened the importance of risk management in competitive environment. How to effectively appraise price of volatility risk is the foundation of risk management. With analysis of the basic features of electricity prices, a model to estimate value-at-risk via GARCHSK specification (GARCHSK-VaR), in which the seasonalities, heteroscedasticities, skewnesses, kurtosises are jointly taken into count, is established. The impacts of probability distribution assumption for innovations on value-at-risk estimate validation are analyzed. The empirical example suggests that the GARCHSK-VaR model performs better in predicting one-period-ahead value-at-risk, but the one with normal distribution underestimates the higher quintiles and the one with student-t distribution overestimates the lower quintiles. © Sila Science.

abstract={How to effectively evaluate price of volatility risk is the basis of risk management in electricity market. Electricity price connotes a grey system, due to uncertainty and incomplete information for partial external or inner parameters. A two-stage model for estimating value-at-risk based on grey system and extreme value theory is proposed. Firstly, in order to capture the dependencies, seasonalities and volatility-clustering, an GM(1,1) model is used to filter electricity price series. In this way, an approximately independently and identically distributed residual series with better statistical properties is acquired. Then extreme value theory is adopted to explicitly model the tails of the residuals of GM(1,1) model, and accurate estimates of electricity market value-at-risk can be produced. The empirical analysis shows that the proposed model can be rapidly reflect the most recent and relevant changes of electricity prices and produce accurate forecasts of value-at-risk at all confidence levels, and the computational cost is far less than the existing two-stage value-at-risk estimating models, further improving the ability of risk management for electricity market participants. © Trade Science Inc.},

abstract={Energy management could be done by analyzing the market risk fortofolio regarded availability and use of energy. The purpose of this study was to analyze risks potential and the availability of energy needed in the agro- industry sector through risk mapping. The framework approach used the principles of risk assessment based on market portfolio risk for agro-industrial sector using VaR (Value at Risk) technique. The subjects of the study were the agro-industries consisting of forest and plantation products industry, marine and fisheries food industry, as well as beverages and tobacco industry. The main types of non-renewable energy sources included petroleum, gas, and coal. The main types of renewable energy sources consisted of hydropower, biomass, micro hydro, geothermal, solar power, and wind power. Primary data consisted of production and energy consumption data of 11 types of existing products in the agro-industry sector. Primary data were obtained by conducting in-depth interviews to industries. Field observations of the condition of the use of energy to produce a ton of products on various agro industries conducted in East Java and West Java as a case study. Secondary data consisted of energy availability data, obtained from the Ministry of Energy and Resources of the Republic of Indonesia. The phases included the risk assessment and risk mapping of energy availability of agro-industry in Indonesia. Risk assessment process used the method of Value at Risk (VaR). The results of the risk assessment were described by using risk maps within the agro-industrial sector. The survey conducted in the province of West Java and East Java gave the information about the need of energy per ton for various types of agro-industries. In addition to the data obtained from the total production, it showed that the agro-industrial sectors which had the highest productions were plantation and forest product industries, i.e. pulp, paper and paper board industry. The second highest productions were crude palm oil and palm cooking oil. The results of the risk mapping indicated that the 6 industries were in quadrant I (tend to be high risk, tend to be high returns), in quadrant III (tend to be low risk, tend to be low returns), and in quadrant IV (tend to be low risk, tend to be high returns). The industries in quadrant I were sugar and paper industries. The industries in quadrant III were processing and preservation of meat, fish canning and other aquatic biota, cooking oil from palm oil, livestock/fish woof, food of chocolate and confectionery, as well as pulp and paper industry. The industries in quadrant IV were instant noodle, soft drink, and the oleo-chemical industry. Based on the results of risk mapping, it needed considerable attention to the energy availability for the sugar and paper industry because they had a fairly high risk (in quadrant I). It was advisable to develop new and renewable energy for the need of energy in these both industries. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) is defined as the combination of vehicle routing, inventory management and delivery scheduling decisions. In this study, a model for a basic inventory routing problem is proposed, which controls the risk of exceeding capital dedicated to an IRP with a value at risk (VaR) measure. It is assumed that the structure of the basic model is one to many, the time horizon is single period and fleet composition is homogeneous. The objective of the model is to minimize the expected total cost over a planning horizon at the same time considering the affordable risk. Since a stochastic IRP is an NP-hard problem and considering VaR makes it more complex, it is not feasible to solve the large-scale problems through an exact model. Hence, a new simulation optimization procedure is proposed to solve the problem. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate its accuracy and applicability. © 2014 Growing Science Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we studied a multi-objective portfolio selection problem with piecewise linear transaction costs in a fuzzy environment. Transaction costs are expenses incurred when buying or selling securities and they are a burden on investors who frequently make trades to balance their portfolio. To better evaluate portfolio performance with transaction costs, this paper extends a previous study to a new model called fuzzy multi-objective portfolio selection model with piecewise linear transaction costs. A fuzzy simulation-based particle swarm optimization algorithm is designed to solve the model considering investors' individual risk attitude. In addition, several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of this model and algorithm. A conclusion is drawn at the end of this paper. © 2014 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.},

abstract={Traditionally, Supply Chain Management (SCM) indicates a strategy enabling an enterprise to achieve optimization of stock level and reduction of lead time through application of information technology. However, such traditional SCM strategy is in contemporary business world required to reflect business economics aspects such as accounting and taxation in order for the enterprise to enjoy maximum benefits. This paper proposes a framework and methodology for optimal profit allocation to participants of multinational enterprises' global supply chain through re-alignment of certain risks assumed by each participant using financial engineering methods. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={We propose a new family of risk measures, called GlueVaR, within the class of distortion risk measures. Analytical closed-form expressions are shown for the most frequently used distribution functions in financial and insurance applications. The relationship between GlueVaR, value-at-risk, and tail value-at-risk is explained. Tail subadditivity is investigated and it is shown that some GlueVaR risk measures satisfy this property. An interpretation in terms of risk attitudes is provided and a discussion is given on the applicability in nonfinancial problems such as health, safety, environmental, or catastrophic risk management. © 2013 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract={Optimal Standardized model plays a significant role in industrial production. This paper studies the optimal system standardize models under the Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk technology. Under the fixed constraints, the paper establishes the optimal system Value-at-Risk technology model. Based on the VaR model and coherent measurement properties, the paper introduces discretization technique and auxiliary variable, puts forward to the optimal Conditional Value-at-Risk technology model. Furthermore, the paper compares the two standardization models by using Monte Carlo Simulation under the MATLAB circumstance. The numerical results indicate that either under different confidence levels or under different expected return, CVaR technology can explain and make decision better than VaR technology. Thus, the paper demonstrates that, in the process of establishing the optimal standardization models, one should take account into Conditional Value-at-Risk technology rather than Value-at-Risk technology. © 2013 IFSA.},

abstract={Power wheeling can have an intensive impact on the reliability and availability of the transmission network that is utilized with it. The extended risk for the transmission system network should be considered by fixing the operation charge for the customer. With the method presented in this paper, the increased risk of disturbances, which are caused by asset outages in the 380 kV level, on feeds of the power plants and the supply of customers in the network area can be clearly identified with a self-developed method which uses a Value at Risk (VaR) analysis. For the presentation a transmission network model is used, which represents the main network of a German transmission system operator (TSO). The illustrated scenario for the application of the developed method consists of a power wheeling operation (PWO) with a transmission capacity of 1 GW, which is carried out from the northernmost to the southernmost coupling points of the transmission network. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to describe travelers' route choice behaviors in a stochastic road network more rationally, a stochastic traffic assignment model with multiple user classes and global elastic demands was presented. In the model, the link and route travel time distributions were analyzed assuming that link capacity follows a uniform distribution; the travelers were differentiated into several classes by their own value of time that follows a certain probability distribution. The model was established as a variational inequality problem based on the assumption that travelers acquire the variability of route travel times based on past experiences and make their route choice considering the travel time budget, which could be determined by the travel time reliability requirement of each user class. A heuristic solution algorithm for solving the model was given and some numerical studies on a simple test network were carried out to demonstrate the practicality of the model. The results show that the proposed model can reflect the impacts of the degradation degree of link capacity, the requirement of travel time reliability and the perception error of traveler on route traffic flow patterns and global demands.},

Subsequently, we turn the proposed problem into its equivalent form. For general task duration distributions, the problem is also very complex, so we cannot solve it by conventional optimization methods. We use stochastic simulation method to estimate Value-at-Risk. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid binary particle swarm optimization algorithm (BPSO) to solve it, where the dynamic programming method (DPM) is used in the second-stage problem. Finally, we conduct some numerical experiments to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the designed algorithm. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The restructuring and deregulation in electric power industry has created the extreme short-time price volatility and heightened the importance of risk management in competitive electricity markets. Accurately characterizing the electricity price volatilities is the foundation to effectively evaluate the price risk in electricity market. With the system demand for electricity as an exogenous explanatory variable, a model to estimate value-at-risk via., a GARCH specification (GARCH-VaR) is proposed, in which the seasonalities, heteroscedasticities, lepkurtosises, heavy-tails and volatility-clustering can be jointly addressed. The impacts of probability distribution assumption and the time-varying features of parameters of the proposed model on the accuracy of VaR estimation are analyzed for three innovation's distributions: normal, student-t and skewed student-t. The numerical example based on the historical data of the PJM electricity market shows that the GARCH-VaR model with conditional skewed student-t innovations performs better in predicting one-period-ahead VaR but the one with Gaussian distribution underestimates the higher quantiles and the one with student-t distribution overestimates the lower quantiles. These results present several potential implications for electricity markets risk quantifications and hedging strategies. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={The international crude oil market is complicated in itself and with the rapid development of China in recent years, the dramatic changes of the international crude oil market have brought some risk to the security of China's oil market and the economic development of China. Value at risk (VaR), an effective measurement of financial risk, can be used to assess the risk of refined oil retail sales as well. However, VaR, as a model that can be applied to complicated nonlinear data, has not yet been widely researched. Therefore, an improved Historical Simulation Approach, historical stimulation of genetic algorithm to parameters selection of support vector machine, "HSGA-SVMF", in this paper, is proposed, which is based on an approach the historical simulation with ARMA forecasts, "HSAF". By comparing it with the HSAF and HSGA-SVMF approach, this paper gives evidence to show that HSGA-SVMF has a more effective forecasting power in the field of amount of refined oil. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Risk management becomes increasingly crucial for financial institutions in competitive market today. Value-at-risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-risk (CVaR) methods have taken important places in risk management field as recognized by Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS, 2012). While VaR measures the maximum loss in a given confidence level and period, CVaR gauges the amount of loss exceeding VaR in a given confidence level. This study attempts to describe and compare VaR and CVaR methods within Malaysian industries using both parametric and non-parametric approaches. Moreover, researcher measures the accuracy of predicted VaR and CVaR by applying "Backtesting" technique. To this regards, results revealed that VaR always tends to underestimate the risk, while CVaR models tend to overestimate the risk in most of the cases. The results also indicated Technology industry with the highest risk, while Consumer Product industry had the lowest one. All in all, the choice of picking the right risk model is highly depend on the preference of institutions in Malaysia. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={What else can airline managers do to reduce the likelihood of financial losses? The US global airline industry is characterized by highly cyclical and inconsistent operating profits, razor-thin profit margins, and unimpressive passenger yields. The objective of this research is to explore a new approach to airline seat allocation in global markets by employing a risk mitigation model, using portfolio theory to diversity an airline's route network. A portfolio of available seat miles distributed to global regions is determined using the Mean-Variance approach, followed by a second portfolio approach, the Mean-Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach. Last, a comparison is made between the two approaches in terms of actual airline operating profits. Given the financial improvements shown by the employed techniques, there is promise in pursing these methods for airline seat allocation.

abstract={Grid-connection of large-scale wind farm brings affect on reliability of power grid due to the fluctuation of wind power output. Based on Weibull probability distribution of wind velocity and output characteristics of single wind power generating unit, a probabilistic model of possibly generated power of wind farm, in which the forced outage rate of units are taken into account, is established and this model can reflect the randomness of wind farm power output. Meanwhile, the tendency of power grid reliability indices varying with the variation of possibly generated power of wind farm is researched. On this basis, considering the defect of traditional single reliability index, the probabilistic distribution of reliability indices of power grid containing wind farm is researched to obtain the indices for the value at risk (VaR) and the conditional value at risk (CVaR) due to grid-connection of wind farm to offer foundation for the planning and operation of wind farms.},

abstract={This article examines how catastrophe events affect risk analysis from a financial perspective. Data from different industries such as Advanced Sustainable Performance Indices, gold, energy, real estate, and insurance were collected and analyzed. The performance of these funds was compared by using various financial ratios. Then we tested the stock selecting and market timing abilities. We also assessed whether a particular catastrophe event has affected stock prices by analysis of two event studies, the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States and the collapse through bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. We examined how an asset portfolio performs under catastrophic events and under the situation of adding Advanced Sustainable Performance Indices into an investor's portfolio basket. We found that the 9/11 terrorist attacks affected the Dow Jones Real Estate Index's prices a lot. Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy filing had a positive impact on the CBOE Gold Index, and had a large impact on the Fidelity US Bond Index. The ASPI Index in our optimization problem gave us better diversification. From our analysis, we conclude that portfolio diversification is a good way to hedge against catastrophic risk. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper seeks to describe and explain managers' newsvendor decisions. These decisions may systematically deviate from profit maximization for several reasons. First, a decision maker may have preferences other than profit maximization. For example, a risk-averse decision maker will systematically order less than the profit maximizing order quantity. Second, a decision maker may apply a heuristic to choose an inventory degree. Under the three new decision making rules, this paper discusses the newsvendor problem and obtains the solution of newsvendor problem for loss averse newsvendor. Finally, comparative static effects of changes in the various price and cost are determined and related to the newsvendor's loss aversion. © 2013 IEEE.},

First, we present the application of normal mixture distributions model in empirical finance where we fit our real data. Second, we present the application of normal mixture distributions model in risk analysis where we apply the normal mixture distributions model to evaluate the value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR) with model validation for both risk measures. The empirical results provide evidence that using the two components normal mixture distributions model can fit the data well and can perform better in estimating value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR) where it can capture the stylized facts of non-normality and leptokurtosis in returns distribution. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel methodology for optimal allocation of a portfolio of risky financial assets. Most existing methods that aim at compromising between portfolio performance (e.g.; expected return) and its risk (e.g.; volatility or shortfall probability) need some statistical model of the asset returns. This means that: (i) one needs to make rather strong assumptions on the market for eliciting a return distribution, and (ii) the parameters of this distribution need be somehow estimated, which is quite a critical aspect, since optimal portfolios will then depend on the way parameters are estimated. Here we propose instead a direct, data-driven, route to portfolio optimization that avoids both of the mentioned issues: the optimal portfolios are computed directly from historical data, by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems (typically, linear programs). Much more importantly, the resulting portfolios are theoretically backed by a guarantee that their expected shortfall is no larger than an a-priori assigned level. This result is here obtained assuming efficiency of the market, under no hypotheses on the shape of the joint distribution of the asset returns, which can remain unknown and need not be estimated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Reckoning the risk of load loss, corresponding to a certain event, into a single MW value can be of premium importance to system operators to quickly initiate a remedial action, if necessary. In this paper, risk to system load loss, due to the inclusion of variable wind generation, is estimated using the value at risk (VaR) concept. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used to construct the wind speed model, through Weibull statistical distribution and a multistate model, as well as the annual load profile, through randomization. A six-bus test system is used to apply the developed notions. Results of incorporating wind turbine generation with the test system, among other conventional generators, have shown that the risk levels increases appreciably. The ease at which the system risk is identified and encapsulated into a quantifiable MW estimate, remains the salient attractive feature of the developed tool. © 2013 IEEE.},

Our results indicate that all models used in this paper can measure dynamic VaR at 95%, 99% and 99.5% confidence levels, and there is no significant difference for different risk model for different stock markets. Moreover, we find also that long memory is not more valuable stylized fact than asymmetry for SSEC and S&P500. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

abstract={Clearly risk can have different meanings but the normal understanding is that the risk could actually happen, and its consequences might not be pleasant. Definitions of risk must always relate to the risk of something happening in a specific time period. A variety of terms are in common usage which are often meaningful to those active in the business within which they are employed, but they can lack precision when it becomes necessary to examine them critically. For example, risk can be used to mean: • a hazard or unsafe practice; • a peril capable of being insured, i.e. fire or storm; • the subject matter of an insurance policy; • a statistical probability; • loss potential as assessed by an insurance surveyor – estimated maximum loss; • the actual value at risk. © 1996 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={In this paper the risk-based maintenance (RBM) strategies monitored by a Value at Risk (VaR) algorithm is described for the asset group's circuit breaker and center break disconnector in the extrahigh voltage transmission system. The created maintenance strategy is based on reliability and availability calculations carried out with a transmission network model of a German transmission system operator (TSO). The findings of these calculations present new criteria which determine the priority of the maintenance activities to the individual asset. The detail level of the used transmission system model is very high. It includes the transmission as well as the sub-transmission, but is mainly focused on the 380 kV extra-high voltage transmission system level. The assets within this level are simulated with age-dependent reliability characteristics. The behavior of all power plant units in the case of an outage of an asset is individually considered. The reliability calculations of the transmission system model are based on a distribution of vertical load situations of the grid. These represent the different vertical load situations in the course of the year. The results of each individual asset are determined and resulting in an individual outage-impact distribution over the year. The VaR algorithm involves a Monte Carlo simulation, which allows monitoring the availability of the network, repair costs and non-delivered energy to the different 110 kV network groups which is caused by the chosen maintenance strategy. This VaR value for the individual asset means a risk that indicates what overall failure costs do not exceed a given probability of 95 percent within one year. The input parameters of the VaR algorithm are the results of the reliability calculations, distributions of the repair costs of equipment and non-delivered energy. The results of the algorithm are the expected costs obtained by the chosen maintenance strategy. Finally, the results are compared with a usual time-based maintenance of these asset groups. © 2013 CIGRE. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper provides an overview of the challenges experienced by a set of adjacent local government councils in collectively identifying the vulnerability of Cockburn Sound and Owen Anchorage coastal zone (Western Australia) to the effects of climate change as well as practical and effective measures to address those identified vulnerabilities. The coast in this area features a wide range of industrial, recreational, residential and commercial activities and is influenced by complex sedimentary and metocean processes as well climate variability. This paper describes the approach adopted by the Cockburn Sound Coastal Alliance (CSCA) to determine those vulnerabilities and identify the 'value at risk' of coastal assets potentially affected by coastal processes under different timeframes and climate change scenarios, for incorporation in the subsequent decision making and planning outcomes. The paper provides an opportunity to practitioners, the consultancy industry and funding bodies to reflect on the challenges (potentially common to other coastal regions) faced by local government authorities in understanding the behavior of complex coastal systems in a context of a lack of long-term coastal datasets, consistent funding opportunities and in-house coastal expertise. It points to the challenges of preparing a good consultant's brief and achieving outputs from the Consultant that meet the client's needs, and the pros and cons of early community engagement in coastal decision-making.},

abstract={We investigate the influence of soft information on integrated risk management in banks. Risk management, capital budgeting and capital structure policies are performed by bank management using information on loan quality provided by a loan officer. The information can be a combination of hard and soft information, the latter being more precise but not verifiable. We set-up a principal-agent framework with moral hazard with hidden information to perform our theoretical analysis. The results show the existence of an incentive of the loan officer to manipulate the soft information, which can be prevented provided an incentive compatible compensation contract. We then show that access to more accurate soft information allows bank management to economize on capital allocation for Value at Risk coverage and to expand capital budgeting for loans origination.},

abstract={On the basis of the portfolio selection theory, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy multiobjective model that can evaluate investment risk properly and increase the probability of obtaining an expected return. In building this model, fuzzy value-at-risk (VaR) is used to evaluate the exact future risk in terms of loss. The VaR can directly reflect the greatest loss of a selection case under a given confidence level. Conversely, variance, the measure of the spread of a distribution around its expected value, is utilized to make the selection more stable. This model can provide investors with more significant information for decision making. To solve this model, an improved Pareto-optimal-set-based multiobjective particle swarm optimization (IMOPSO) algorithm is designed to obtain better solutions in the Pareto front. The proposed model and algorithm are exemplified by specific numerical examples. Furthermore, comparisons are made between IMOPSO and other existing approaches. Experiments show that the model and algorithm are effective in solving the multiobjective portfolio selection problem. © 2012 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.},

abstract={How to effectively evaluate price of volatility risk is the basis of risk management in electricity market. With comprehensive analysis of the basic features and influencing factors of electricity prices, a GARCH model of computing value-at-risk (VaR) is proposed, in which the seasonalities, heteroscedasticities, kurtosises and heavy-tails, volatility-clustering and relationship to system loads are jointly addressed. The impacts on VaR estimation by the probability distribution assumption and the time-varying features of parameters for three innovation's distributions, normal, student-t and Gram-Charlier series expansion of the normal density function are analyzed. The numerical example based on the historical data of the PJM market shows that the GARCH-VaR model, in which the innovation's probability distribution is consistent with Gram-Charlier series expansion of the normal density function and the time-varying characteristics of skewness and kurtosis are considered, performs better in predicting one-period-ahead VaR, but the one with normal distribution underestimates the higher quantiles and the one with student-t distribution overestimates the lower quantiles. These results present several potential implications for electricity markets risk quantifications and hedging strategies.},

abstract={The paper first argues that risk management should not exclude extreme risks. In the past, beyond a low level of probability deemed acceptable, prevention efforts were sometimes considered unnecessary. The Fukushima accident exemplifies this attitude. In the financial sector, the risk indicator has long been the value at risk (VaR). Because severe losses are not covered by the VaR, additional approaches of extreme risk have been proposed, for example the peak over the threshold (POT). In a second section, the paper focuses on nuclear accidents which can be considered as extreme risks: low probability, high cost. Previous cost estimates have mainly covered radiological consequences i.e. health effects and the cost of countermeasures aimed at reducing these effects. But neglecting other consequences underestimates accident costs and therefore the economic value of preventive actions. In a third section, the impact of a nuclear accident on Tourism is used as an example of cost components which have not been estimated in the past. The estimation methodology is briefly explained. Results show that, in case of controlled radioactive releases, tourism would be mainly affected through an image impact. In contrast, massive radioactive releases would affect Tourism "directly" because large areas of land would be significantly contaminated. Economic losses would be three times larger than those of a severe accident. Direct costs could represent a significant proportion of the value added of the whole tourism industry. The total cost for the French economy is not negligible; it is estimated at 1% of the French GDP and higher, for this particular component of the total cost of a nuclear accident being the impact on the tourism.},

abstract={A time-varying multiple Copula model was constructed, and the Monte Carlo simulation technology was used to calculate VaR (Value at Risk) in order to accurately measure the risk resulting from the four exchange rates: CNY/USD, CNY/EUR, CNY/JPY and CNY/HKD of commercial Banks. Then, a comparative analysis was made on the measurement effect between the static multiple Copula-VaR and the time-varying multiple Copula-VaR. The results show that the connections between these exchange rates are indeed time-varying related, and the measurement effect of the time-varying multiple Copula-VaR is much better.},

abstract={Hydrothermal systems optimal operation includes a step of optimizing the resources that are valued system storable. This optimization is performed traditionally by a stochastic dynamic programming in which the objective function to minimize is the expected value of future cost of operation, also known as Bellman function. While in theory, minimize the expected value of future cost of operation is "objective" in practice there are many reasons why the actual operation includes additional precautions, sometimes actually taken by operators who are the ones which have responsibility for the consequences of the operation or sometimes made based on safety considerations were not introduced in the optimization of the operation. This work shows the implementation on the platform Simulation of Electric Power Systems of stochastic dynamic programming algorithm for specifying the objective function cost reduction future with a certain probability of exceedance. This work was performed as part of the draft platform enhancements SimSEE with funding from the Energy Sector A(II. The paper presents the results of the operation to minimize the expected value of future cost and minimizing the risk value of 5% of being exceeded. Both operations are compared both costs achieved as in the qualitative aspects. The results allow evaluating the cost of being introduced by risk averse and also identify situations where there are major differences. It also discusses the impact on the marginal cost of system operation with a slogan risk averse. This value is relevant because it is the basis for calculating the Uruguayan market spot price. These scenarios correspond to the operation in 2017 with high penetration of wind energy in the system. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Regarding the uncertainty of traffic supply, demand and decision principles in traffic design, a design model for uncertain discrete traffic network based on uncertainty theory is proposed. Firstly, supply and demand elements are assumed to be stochastic variables. The semi-standard error and value at risk are used to measure uncertainty and a multi-objective bi-level optimized model considering decision risk attitude is built. Then, SPEA2 (strength pareto evolutionary algorithm 2) based on the conception of Pareto is applied to solve the multi-objective bi-level optimized model. The numerical results of Nguyen-Dupuis network show that the risk value can reflect decision maker's attitude towards risk in measuring traffic design. In various targets there are alternative relations in multi-object design. The increase of the construction funds can effectively improve the network performance. However, such improvement is not obvious when the investment is beyond a certain limit.},

abstract={In the field of energy efficient retrofit of buildings the improvement of the building envelope is central to gain a low energy demand and user comfort in modernized buildings. The reduction of the heat transmission through the hull of the reused building fabric binds a reasonable amount of new resources for a long time. A life cycle model for façade retrofit implementation is missing. The aim is the optimization of life cycle design parameters of a newly developed façade retrofit system which fulfills fundamental sustainability issues throughout its life cycle e.g. efficient use of resources, good performance in terms of building physics during operation, less maintenance, and handling when becoming waste. The introduced system describes a retrofit method based preferably on timber and other renewable resources. A pre-evaluation of a recently completed case study project has featured relatively high results for resource consumption of certain retrofit scenario. The resulting target has to be the reduction of value at risk of the entire system due to resource inefficiency, complexity and even end of life. These issues may restrict the market access of a firm solution although it shows positive results to the aspect of environmental impact. The challenge is to balance and improve the performance of the interdependent sub-systems parameters. In timber construction it is necessary to compose material layers in order to ensure the technical properties of the final prefabricated element in combination with the existing exterior wall. In the same line it allows to leverage the properties of the appropriate panels, components etc., and to optimize the used components. The most important parameters of the system behavior are identified for life cycle relevant component characteristics e.g. material use, maintenance, repair, dismantling, separation, recycling. They raise the awareness of flaws, allow a management of risks, and finally demand new technologies for the improvement of the elements' resource efficiency.},

Amongst the competing VaR methodologies evaluated in this paper, besides the commonly used benchmark models, a MC simulation approach and a Hybrid MC with Historical Simulation approach, both assuming various processes for the underlying spot prices, are also being employed. All VaR models are empirically tested on eight spot energy commodities that trade futures contracts on NYMEX and the Spot Energy Index. A two-stage evaluation and selection process is applied, combining statistical and economic measures, to choose amongst the competing VaR models.

abstract={This paper presents a methodology to define the trading policy of an energy generation agent. The proposed approach uses stochastic programming to represent the uncertainty related to the short-term price fluctuation. The aim of the model (based on possible prices) is to identify the composition of an optimum portfolio in accordance with the decision-maker risk perception. The most important contribution of this paper is the fact that the risk criteria are considered in the decision-making model. This is done through the use of tools such as Value at Risk (VaR) and the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Despite the fact that the calculation of CVaR requires previous knowledge of VaR, in the proposed model both risk measures are simultaneously determined. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In view of the intermittency and uncertainty associated with both the electricity production sector of restructured power system and their competitive markets, it is necessary to develop an appropriate risk managing scheme. So that it is desirable to trade-off between optimum utilization of intermittent generation resources (i.e. renewable energy resources), uncertain market prices and related risks in order to maximize participants benefits and minimize the corresponding risks in the multi-product market environment. The main goal of this paper is to investigate risk management by introducing a novel multi-risk index to quantify expected downside risk (EDR) which is caused by both the wind power and market price uncertainties. Value-at-Risk (VaR) method is used to assess the mentioned risk issue by the proposed weighted EDR, so that an optimal trade-off between the profit and risk is made for the system operations. Also, the roulette wheel mechanism is employed for random market price scenario generation wherein the stochastic procedure is converted into its respective deterministic equivalents. Moreover, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is employed to characterize the stochastic wind farm (WF) generation by predetermined mean level and standard deviation of wind behavior as well as temporal correlation.

abstract={This article develops a methodology for quantifying model risk in quantile risk estimates. The application of quantile estimates to risk assessment has become common practice in many disciplines, including hydrology, climate change, statistical process control, insurance and actuarial science, and the uncertainty surrounding these estimates has long been recognized. Our work is particularly important in finance, where quantile estimates (called Value-at-Risk) have been the cornerstone of banking risk management since the mid 1980s. A recent amendment to the Basel II Accord recommends additional market risk capital to cover all sources of "model risk" in the estimation of these quantiles. We provide a novel and elegant framework whereby quantile estimates are adjusted for model risk, relative to a benchmark which represents the state of knowledge of the authority that is responsible for model risk. A simulation experiment in which the degree of model risk is controlled illustrates how to quantify Value-at-Risk model risk and compute the required regulatory capital add-on for banks. An empirical example based on real data shows how the methodology can be put into practice, using only two time series (daily Value-at-Risk and daily profit and loss) from a large bank. We conclude with a discussion of potential applications to nonfinancial risks. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract={Existing methods for the assessment of the potential impacts of climate change in productive activities and sectors are usually limited to point estimates that do not consider the inherent variability and uncertainty of climatic and socioeconomic variables. This is a major drawback given that only a limited and potentially misleading estimation of risk can be expected when ignoring such determinant factors. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced that is capable of integrating the agent's beliefs and expert judgment into the assessment of the potential impacts of climate change in a quantitative manner by means of an objective procedure. The goal is to produce tailor-made information to assist decision-making under uncertainty in a way that is consistent with the current state of knowledge and the available subjective "expert" information. Time-charts of the evolution of different risk measures, that can be relevant for assisting decision-making and planning, can be constructed using this new methodology. This methodology is illustrated with a case study of coffee production in Mexico. Time-dependent probabilistic scenarios for coffee production and income, conditional on the agent's beliefs and expert judgment, are developed for the average producer under uncertain future conditions. It is shown that variability in production and income, generated by introducing climate variability and uncertainty are important factors affecting decision-making and the assessment of economic viability that are frequently ignored. The concept of Value at Risk, commonly applied in financial risk management, is introduced as a means for estimating the maximum expected loss for a previously chosen confidence level. Results are tailor-made for agents that have incomplete information and different beliefs. In this case study, the costs of climate change for coffee production in Veracruz are estimated to have a present value representing from 3 to 14 times the current annual value of coffee production in the state. © 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract={In order to study the stability value-at-risk calculation of a foundation pit of subway station, the calculation method and process of single-factor risk ratio, factors combination risk ratio and value-at-risk were constructed based on the combination of probability analysis theory in the uncertainty analysis theory and function failure theory. The results show that building a high dimensions mapping model from influencing factor to response value can compute the single-factor risk ratio better based on the numerical methods which combined with the Monte Carlo simulation analysis method. The stability of the foundation pit is controlled by the integral landslide, soil parameters follow the normal distribution, and the manner of excavation and supporting follows the Beta distribution. Through the calculation of factors combination risk ratio and value-at-risk, the degree of probabilistic risk of the foundation pit can be differentiated, and the value-at-risk can be estimated further.},

abstract={This paper deals with the calculation methods and the corresponding steps of the value-at-risk due to the construction period change, based on the total probability and the Monte Carlo thoughts. In the investigation, first, the risk probability is calculated for the project without anomalous change during the construction, with anomalous change but without remedial measures, and with anomalous change as well as remedial measures. Based on the probability calculation in the three above-mentioned cases, a calculation formula of full-probability method of abnormal project time is established. Then, by using the Monte Carlo thoughts, the Monte Carlo method calculation steps of the value-at-risk are presented based on Matlab, and the construction period change is described with the Beta distribution function. Finally, with an excavation engineering of a subway station as an example, the value-at-risk during the excavation period and the supporting period is calculated. The results indicate that the full-probability method and the Monte Carlo method are both effective.},

abstract={The paper presents the optimization algorithm which may eventually be used by electric energy suppliers to coordinate charging and discharging of electric-drive vehicles (EDVs) exploited in electricity markets. The research is focused on a day-ahead market and a provision of system regulation in an ancillary-service market. The proposed optimization minimizes the charging costs that can be partly compensated with profits obtained from participation in the energy markets. Due to the stochastic nature of transportation patterns, the Monte Carlo simulation is applied to model uncertainties presented by numerous scenarios. To reduce the problem complexity, the simulated driving patterns are not individually considered in the optimization but clustered into fleets using the GAMS/SCENRED tool. Uncertainties of energy requirements in the market and energy prices are presented by statistical central moments that are further considered in Hong's $2 - {\rm point} +1$ estimation method in order to define points considered in the optimization. Finally, each energy supplier has to offer competitive energy prices to EDV users for transportation. Due to uncertainties, the final prices cannot be deterministically calculated; thus, the paper proposes the risk-based approach applying value at risk. Case studies illustrate the application of the proposed optimization in achieving competitive prices for EDV users. © 2012 IEEE.},

The algorithm improves the local search ability by introducing the idea of local disturbance and variation operation, and maintains the external file with the idea of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. We have a detailed analysis of the risk of purchasing electricity of grid company, and establish a model of the risk to purchase electricity taking the minimum of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and the maximum of the expected revenue as goals. This model makes up the flaw of Value at Risk (VaR) that it is not able to reflect the loss rear part information, guards against the small probability extreme risk, reduces the possibility of grid company to have the disastrous risk, and does not need the priori knowledge. We use the improved particle swarm algorithm to solve the model, each time a set of optimal solutions can be calculated, and the optimal solution evenly distributed in the optimal front end, which provides a reference of correct decisions for policy-makers. And the relative experiments prove that the algorithm and the model are feasible.},

abstract={To solve timing planning problem of clustering wind farms, a method was proposed which could orchestrate investment economy of wind farms and adaptability risk of peak-load regulation by the investment timing coordination of wind farms and general units. The relationship between investment and operation of wind farms and units was depicted with investment timing matrix and operation state matrix. The index of value at risk (VaR) of peak-load regulating capacity vacancy was presented to measure the adaptability risk and risk assessment method considering correlation of wind speed was proposed. The value of options portfolio was introduced to measure the economy of investment timing of clustering wind farms, and economic value evaluation model was established considering the learning effect. Based on the above study, bi-level programming model was built to realize the organic unity of investment economy and adaptability risk of peak-load regulation and risk equivalent coefficient was introduced to endow the penalty factor with definite techno-economic significance. Mixed algorithm of Monte-Carlo simulation and genetic algorithm was proposed to solve the above model. Test system study results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective. © 2012 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.},

abstract={This study investigates unconditional distributions of daily log-returns of Japanese security prices from a comprehensive point of view. The purpose of this article is to estimate a risk distribution of stocks in terms of Value-at-Risk (VaR) in order to select low risk securities from many securities. Daily log-return time series of 1,340 Japanese companies listed on the first section of Tokyo Stock Exchange are examined during the last one decade. I develop a method to estimate VaR by both the maximum likelihood estimation procedure under a q-Gaussian assumption and analytical form of its cumulative distribution function. It is confirmed that they are fitted to q-Gaussian distributions (Student t-distributions) with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. It is found that the complementary cumulative distribution function of VaR has a power-law tail with its characteristic exponent depending on values of the VaR percentile. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

abstract={This paper presents the derivation of the probability distribution of maintenance cost of a repairable system that is modeled as a stochastic alternating renewal process. The key idea of the paper is to formulate a renewal equation for computing the characteristic function of the maintenance cost incurred in a fixed time interval. Then, the inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic function leads to the complete probability distribution of cost. This approach also enables the derivation of probability distributions of the down time and the number of failures in a given time period. The distribution of the cost can be used to evaluate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and other measures needed for the financial planning of a maintenance program. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group.},

In both cases, the Bayesian VaR and ES fully take into account parameter uncertainty and non-linear relationship between ordinary and logarithmic returns. We use the n-variate type I MSF-SBEKK(1,1) volatility model proposed specially to cope with large n. We compare empirical results obtained using this (more demanding) multivariate approach and the much simpler univariate approach based on modelling volatility of the whole portfolio (of a given structure).},

abstract={An accurate wholesale electricity market forecast has become an essential tool in bidding and hedging strategies in competitive electricity markets. This paper provides a dynamic asymmetric long memory heteroscedastic model to account the high volatile daily wholesale electricity markets in New England and Louisiana. This model implemented power Cox-Box transformation (Tse, 1998) under the Chung's (1999) model specification to the time-varying volatility. The model is able to capture various empirical stylized facts that commonly observed in electricity markets including clustering volatility, news impact, heavy-tailed and long memory volatility. Under the forecast evaluations, the long memory model outperformed the traditional model in all the forecast time-horizons. Finally, the outcome of the analysis is further applied in quantifying the market risk in term of value-at-risk. © 2011 Academic Journals.},

abstract={The investment decision on the placement of wind turbines is, neglecting legal formalities, mainly driven by the aim to maximize the expected annual energy production of single turbines. The result is a concentration of wind farms at locations with high average wind speed. While this strategy may be optimal for single investors maximizing their own return on investment, the resulting overall allocation of wind turbines may be unfavorable for energy suppliers and the economy because of large fluctuations in the overall wind power output. This paper investigates to what extent optimal allocation of wind farms in Germany can reduce these fluctuations. We analyze stochastic dependencies of wind speed for a large data set of German on- and offshore weather stations and find that these dependencies turn out to be highly nonlinear but constant over time. Using copula theory we determine the value at risk of energy production for given allocation sets of wind farms and derive optimal allocation plans. We find that the optimized allocation of wind farms may substantially stabilize the overall wind energy supply on daily as well as hourly frequency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Value at Risk estimated with joint distribution methodologies demonstrates that risk is lower for portfolios of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and smallbusiness equities compared with a single-asset holding. Benefits from diversification were largest in 2001-2003 and the smallest from 2006-2008. Previous research using Value at Risk points out the importance of model selection. Various estimation approaches affected results modestly over the entire period (1989-mid 2008). The Value at Risk is -3.1% for two copula models and -3.2% for a nonparametric empirical joint density, at a 1% probability level for weekly returns. After June 1996, the nonparametric copula model consistently returned the lowest risk estimate among the three joint distribution methods. Time-varying risk is a more important driver in the results than model specification. The highest portfolio risk was found for the period after August 2006 (weekly losses of 4.4% to 5%). The distribution-based model results were closer to the undiversified model results than in the earlier time periods, which supports the premise that contagion across asset classes characterises the post-2006 real estate bust, but is not a strong characteristic of the market over a longer investment horizon that includes growth phases of the business cycle. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Wetlands are ecologically important due to their hydrologic attributes and their role as ecotones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Based on a 2-year study in the Yellow River Delta Wetland and a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, we discovered temporal and spatial relationships between soil water content and three representative plant species (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., Suaeda salsa (Linn.) Pall, and Tamarix chinensis Lour.). We selected eight indices (biodiversity, biomass, and the uptake of TN, TP, K, Ca, Mg, and Na) at three scales (community, single plant, and micro-scale) to assess ecological risk. We used the ecological value at risk (EVR) model, based on the three scales and eight indices, to calculate EVR and generate a three-level classification of ecological risk using MCMC simulation. The high-risk areas at a community scale were near the Bohai Sea. The high-risk areas at a single-plant scale were near the Bohai Sea and along the northern bank of the Yellow River. At a micro-scale, we found no concentration of high-risk areas. The results will provide a foundation on which the watershed's planners can allocate environmental flows and guide wetland restoration. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In the electricity market, the uncertainty of electric quantity and price is the ultimate form of electricity market risk. This paper analyzes the risk of Power Gird Company (PGC) in the Direct Electricity Purchasing (DEP) in terms of policy risks, market risks and operational risks, which shows that the three risks influence and control each other. A risk control and assessment model for PGC based on utility function and Value at Risk (VaR) is proposed by refering to modern investment combination theory in financial field, and also the concept of transfer factor is presented. The calculation results show that the proposed model can truly reflect the essential market risks that PGC faces in the DEP process. Meanwhile, the proposed transfer factor provides a quantitative tool for PGC in the DEP environment and it is pointed out that PGC can benefit from DEP through appropriate risk control methods. Finally, a framework for risk management is proposed, which can help PGC to achieve its business objectives of maximizing its benefits and minimizing the corresponding risks.},

After a matrix for key risk allocation was established, with regard to the key risk factors that BT host bears, the methods in engineering cost theory and engineering economic theory were adopted, and the adjustment model for repurchase basic price in urban rail traffic BT project was established, which resolved the issue of adjustment of repurchase basic price in BT project qualitatively; with regard to the key risk factors that BT contractor bears, the Monte Carlo simulation value at risk (VaR) model was used and the quantitative model was set up for return on investment(ROI) in urban rail traffic BT project, which resolved the issue of determination of ROI quantitatively. The conclusion that the research arrives at makes the pricing theory for urban rail traffic BT project more instructive and provides a new idea for studying the determination of the repurchase price of urban rail traffic BT project.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the margin of Chinese Stock Index Futures using GARCH-VaR model and Monte Carlo simulation respectively. The result of the empirical study shows that the model of GARCH-VaR is more precise in describing the proper margin level. Furthermore, the average margin level of the long is higher than the short, which means the long is exposed to more risks than the short Moreover, we find that the level of the margin is lower than current domestic stock index futures security level at both 99% and 95% confidence level. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This conference paper discusses a risk allocation problem for subprime investing banks involving investment in subprime structured mortgage products (SMPs) and Treasuries. In order to solve this problem, we develop a L ́evy process-based model of jump diffusion-type for investment choice in subprime SMPs and Treasuries. This model incorporates subprime SMP losses for which credit default insurance in the form of credit default swaps (CDSs) can be purchased. In essence, we solve a mean swap-at-risk (SaR) optimization problem for investment which determines optimal allocation between SMPs and Treasuries subject to credit risk protection via CDSs. In this regard, SaR is indicative of how much protection investors must purchase from swap protection sellers in order to cover possible losses from SMP default. Here, SaR is defined in terms of value-at-risk (VaR). Finally, we provide an analysis of the aforementioned optimization problem and its connections with the subprime mortgage crisis (SMC).},

abstract={The rapid development of emerging technology products (ETPs) in China'smarket makes it important to evaluate and forecast ETPs diffusion. Due to the high uncertainty of ETP marketing and inadequate marketing data of China ETPs markets, the traditional forecasting methods cannot be applied to effectively measure it. We use cellular automata embedded small world network (CASWN) and crossentropy (CE) divergence to measure the differences of the ETP adopters' spatial distribution. The empirical analysis indicates the success probabilities of ETPs can be predicted effectively though CASWN a d CE divergence, which can make a precise judgment for the market prospect of an ETP in the shortest time after an ETP launch. Based on this, we can calculate the expected cash flow accurately and the option value of an ETP project for sound decision-making. In the meantime, the CE threshold value of success of ETPs in China market is obtained only by the spatial data of early-stage after an ETP launch, not rely on time series data. So a new tool is provided for the prediction and venture capital policy of an ETP launch in this article. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Usually, risk assessment is a combination of risk analysis and risk appraisal to evaluate the consequences and frequencies of hazardous events. The acceptability of the exposed risk is also judged in the process. In this regard, the financial risk matrix could be a useful tool based on the frequency and expected loss of damage. Thus, it is adopted in this study where a financial approach has been taken in risk assessment; the proposed methodology uses frequencies from chemical accident records and value at risk (VaR). The methodology consists of mainly five steps. It starts with hazard identification, and is followed by adjustment of history-based accident frequencies by using severity ratios. Then, accident probability and expected damage loss are estimated. The results obtained in the previous two steps are combined to compute VaR for the target process; this value is mapped with financial risk matrix to re-evaluate accident frequency. As an illustrative case, Texas BP refinery accident in 2005 is studied according to the proposed methodology. The results indicate that the financial risk increased from a low level to a medium high level after the occurrence of the tragic accident. As similar accidents frequently occurred for the same process, the risk of the process should have been increased. This proposed method can reflect this dynamic change in risks with the help of accident records and their impacts. Copyright © 2011 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={In many problems of risk analysis, failure is equivalent to the event of a random risk factor exceeding a given threshold. Failure probabilities can be controlled if a decisionmaker is able to set the threshold at an appropriate level. This abstract situation applies, for example, to environmental risks with infrastructure controls; to supply chain risks with inventory controls; and to insurance solvency risks with capital controls. However, uncertainty around the distribution of the risk factor implies that parameter error will be present and the measures taken to control failure probabilities may not be effective. We show that parameter uncertainty increases the probability (understood as expected frequency) of failures. For a large class of loss distributions, arising from increasing transformations of location-scale families (including the log-normal, Weibull, and Pareto distributions), the article shows that failure probabilities can be exactly calculated, as they are independent of the true (but unknown) parameters. Hence it is possible to obtain an explicit measure of the effect of parameter uncertainty on failure probability. Failure probability can be controlled in two different ways: (1) by reducing the nominal required failure probability, depending on the size of the available data set, and (2) by modifying of the distribution itself that is used to calculate the risk control. Approach (1) corresponds to a frequentist/regulatory view of probability, while approach (2) is consistent with a Bayesian/personalistic view. We furthermore show that the two approaches are consistent in achieving the required failure probability. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of data pooling and its systemic risk implications. © 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract={In view of the uncertainty and intermittency of wind power, this paper proposes an optimal economical dispatch (ED) model and develops a method to estimate risk and manage hybrid power systems (traditional + wind power systems) for the short-term (24 h) operations. The model and the method have taken into account the large wind power penetration and the wind variability. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with constraints is applied to solve the ED problem. Value at risk (VaR) and integrated risk management (IRM) are used separately to assess the risk, so that an optimal tradeoff between the profit and risk is made for the system operations. The model and the method are tested on the standard IEEE 30-bus power system and network in Shanghai. The validity of the model and the method has been approved. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={This article describes an intelligent simulation method for measuring price risk, which is still one of the focused and unsolved problems for various risk managements and need to be studied profoundly. To solve this problem, electricity price risk measured in terms of Value at Risk is proposed by intelligent simulation. Here the electricity price data under various market scenarios are produced by intelligent simulation model based on fuzzy neural network (FNN). After that, the quantitative model for price risk analysis is achieved by finding the estimated probability distribution, where price VAR is determined, according to parameter set, i.e. confidence level. The proposed method is more realistic and effective than traditional variance approach, which can assess the potential loss of electricity price over some period of time.},

abstract={This paper applies the extreme value theory on Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculation, which focuses on modeling the tails of the return distribution rather than the whole distribution. Extreme value theory has more meaning during the volatile market conditions, under which the distribution of returns almost has a fat tail. Because of its biggest advantage of comprehensive, VaR calculation has become the mainstream method of measuring risk. This paper deals with the behavior of the tails of financial series. More specifically, the focus is the use of extreme value theory to assess tail related risk. The application of extreme value theory is illustrated by an example from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock market data. The paper concludes that the both distributions are fat tails and the limit distribution for centralized and normalized maxima is a Frechet type. So the extreme value theory is properly applied and it's a useful complement to traditional VaR methods. ©2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Value at Risk (VaR ) is a method using statistical knowledge to measure financial risks, and its calculating core is to estimate or predicate fluctuation of the financial assets price. In recent years, the main method of estimating and predicating fluctuation of the financial assets price is the GARCH model. So to determine a reasonable GARCH model becomes the crux of VaR calculating. In this paper, we proposed using empirical likelihood method to estimate VaR , and we also proved that the empirical likelihood method is more effective and more concise than other current methods by simulation analysis. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.},

In this article I will show the structure of the hybrid method, the problems which occurred during the construction of the model and the solutions for the problems. I will show the results of the model and compare them with the results of another financial default forecast model.

abstract={This paper employs the Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to measure the 'Value at Risk' (VaR) of EUA futures prices. The results show that during the sample period: first, the EVT approach can be used to reliably measure the extreme risk of carbon futures markets of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, both for Phase I and Phase II. Second, the downside extreme risk of carbon futures market outweighs the upside risk, with evident asymmetric features. Moreover, the average VaR of carbon futures contract DEC10 proves much less than that of contract DEC07 during the sample period. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={This paper compares traditional portfolio insurance strategies with modern risk-based dynamic asset allocation strategies within a currency portfolio context for reserve management. Given the objective of preserving reserve value, the evaluation of the hedging performances of various strategies focuses on four perspectives regarding, in particular, the return distribution of the hedged portfolio. In terms of the Sharpe Ratio, the constant proportional portfolio insurance is the best performer due to having the lowest volatility, while the Value at Risk strategy based upon the normal distribution is the worst due to its having the smallest return. From the perspective that the return distribution of the hedged portfolio is shifted to the right, the synthetic put performs the best, with the expected shortfall strategy the second best. In terms of the cumulative portfolio return across years, the expected shortfall strategy using the historical distribution ranks first, as a result of its participation in upward markets. Furthermore, the expected shortfall-based strategy results in a lower turnover within the investment horizon, thereby saving transaction costs. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Failure of a single component on-board a spacecraft can compromise the integrity of the whole system and put its entire capability and value at risk. Part of this fragility is intrinsic to the current dominant design of space systems, which is mainly a single, large, monolithic system. The space industry has therefore recently proposed a new architectural concept termed fractionation, or co-located space-based network (SBN). By physically distributing functions in multiple orbiting modules wirelessly connected, this architecture allows the sharing of resources on-orbit (e.g., data processing, downlinks). It has been argued that SBNs could offer significant advantages over the traditional monolithic architecture as a result of the network structure and the separation of sources of risk in the spacecraft. Careful quantitative analyses are still required to identify the conditions under which SBNs can "outperform" monolithic spacecraft. In this work, we develop Markov models of module failures and replacement to quantitatively compare the lifecycle cost and utility of both architectures. We run Monte-Carlo simulations of the models, and discuss important trends and invariants. We then investigate the impact of our model parameters on the existence of regions in the design space in which SBNs "outperform" the monolith spacecraft on a cost, utility, and utility per unit cost basis. Beyond the life of one single spacecraft, this paper compares the cost and utility implications of maintaining each architecture type through successive replacements. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Stress testing is an appealing risk-management tool because it provides risk managers with additional information on possible portfolio losses arising from extreme, although plausible, scenarios. In a volatile financial environment, stress tests have recently become more important as an instrument to gauge the impact of specific adverse developments in the economy. Stress testing may be increasingly used by financial firms for both internal and external purposes. This Article offers a conceptual framework for defining stress testing, describing its possible applications, highlight certain techniques developed to conduct this testing including a few methods for identifying stress scenarios and survey its recent use by supervisory agencies. The usefulness of stress tests as risk management tool crucially depends on the choice of stress scenarios: if the scenario is too implausible, the stress test results will be ignored by management. There is no generally accepted standard how to choose scenarios. Many institutions apply some standardized scenarios derived from extreme market moves in the past.

abstract={Power sector restructuring has prompted the application of modern portfolio theory among market participants. Much research has been devoted to power portfolio optimization problems. However, the portfolio composition adopted in literature is rather hypothetical than realistic. From an engineering perspective, it is necessary to use real traded contract products to construct the portfolio. In this paper, clarification is made on commonly traded power contracts in the market, followed by a discussion of their pricing schemes. It is emphasized that actively traded electricity futures/forwards and options actually belong to commodity swaps and swaptions respectively. A power portfolio is then constructed for a generation company with these basic power contracts and the spot transaction as well. An optimization model is formulated to solve the asset allocation with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. The viability of the model is tested through a numerical study. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={For many years, natural disasters were perceived as unavoidable strokes of misfortune brought about by nature's unpredictable forces. Taking into consideration the magnitude of the tsunami in Asia in 2004, the heavy floods in Mozambique in 2000, and Hurricane Mitch in Central America in 1998, we can see that developing countries are the most victims of such events, mostly due to their limited capacities and resources to mitigate disasters. On another hand is quite visible the efforts that are put on places both to reduce vulnerability of social and economic assets all over the world and high amounts of money invested in order to make the world more comfortable for everybody. Paradoxically, the development of world together with the increase of the world population has become one of the problems that create instability worldwide. The increase of greenhouse effect, climate change and megacities are the primarily indicators of such situation. Direct correlation exists between the increase of number of economic damages and human losses with the magnitude of natural disaster hazards. Many socio-economic assets and human lives are at risk as a direct result of volatile environment at which they are exposed. Societies that are unable to adequately protect themselves from natural hazards and their impacts are at particular risk. As a consequence of poverty, a surge in population growth, the overuse of natural resources, and shortfalls in institutional capacities, affected groups are frequently unable to prevent disasters. Moreover, global climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of natural hazards, with catastrophic results. This paper stresses the correlation between the volatile environment and value (elements) at risk that influence the impact over social and economic assets worldwide. © SGEM2010 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM Published by STEF92 Technology Ltd.},

abstract={This study presents a statistical model of surface layer wind velocity amplitude relying on the notion of continuous cascades. Inspired by recent empirical findings that suggest the existence of some cascading process in the mesoscale range, we consider that wind speed can be described by a seasonal ARMA model where the noise term is "multifractal" i.e., associated with a random cascade. This model can find applications in short-term forecasting: the obtained results show a systematic improvement of the prediction as compared to reference models like persistence or Artificial Neural Networks. We also address the problem of estimation of wind speed conditional laws. It leads to wind speed distributed according to "transformed" Rice pdf. Such a prediction can be useful to handle specific risk related problems (e.g., the probability that a given event occurs during the next hour or day or the calibration of some "value at risk"). The reliability of the obtained conditional laws are backtested by the means of "p-p plots".},

abstract={Based on credibility theory, this paper presents a class of two-stage fuzzy programming with value-at-risk (VaR) to deal with material procurement planning (MPP) problem. Since the MPP problem usually includes continuous fuzzy variable parameters with infinite supports, it is inherently an infinite-dimensional optimization problem that can rarely be solved directly. To overcome this difficultly, this paper introduces an approximation approach (AA) which can turn the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional optimization one. Furthermore, in order to solve the proposed MPP model, a hybrid algorithm is designed which combines AA, neural network (NN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Additionally, one numerical example is also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Economic and population growth have led to an unprecedented increase in the value at risk in coastal zones over the last century. To avoid excessive future losses, particularly in the light of projected climate change impacts, coastal zone managers have various instruments at their disposal. These primarily concern land-use planning (establishing buffer zones) and engineering solutions (beach nourishment and coastal protection). In this paper, we focus on risk mitigation through the implementation of buffer zones (setback lines). Foregoing land-use opportunities in coastal regions and protecting coasts is costly, but so is damage caused by inundation and storm erosion. Defining appropriate setback lines for land-use planning purposes is a balancing act. It is however unclear what level of protection is facilitated by current approaches for defining setback lines, and whether this is, at least from an economic perspective, sufficient. In this paper, we present an economic model to determine which setback lines would be optimal from an economic perspective. The results provide a useful reference point in the political debate about the acceptability of risk in coastal zones. The main conclusions are (i) that it is useful to define setback lines on the basis of their exceedance probabilities, (ii) that the exceedance probability of an economically efficient setback line will typically be in the order of magnitude of 1/100 per year, (iii) that it is important to distinguish between situations in which morphological conditions are stationary and non-stationary, and (iv) that long-term uncertainties (e.g. due to climate change) influence the exceedance probability of efficient setback lines but only to a limited extent.},

abstract={Probabilistic methods for reserves estimation, including uncertainty quantification and probabilistic aggregation, have gained widespread recognition in the oil and gas industry, since the first comprehensive guidelines were issued by the SPE in 2001. The probabilistic methods now used, as proposed in these guidelines, are similar to those also used in portfolio theory by the finance industry. A lot can be learned from the extensive experience with probabilistic methods and quantification of risk with measures like Value-at-Risk in portfolio theory. Especially, the guidelines issued by the Basel II Accord and since the recent financial crisis contain important lessons. As a first step, we examine a fundamental question. Is the P90 reserves value an appropriate measure for quantifying the reserves downside? For the P90 value to be considered a good measure of the reserves downside, it needs to possess a number of basic characteristics involving P90 for each field and the probabilistically aggregated P90 value for the portfolio of fields. We define these characteristics and through examples will demonstrate that the P90 reserves estimate, in general, meets the requirements of a good measure of reserves downside. A possible uncertainty scenario, where some of these characteristics do not hold, is also given. An alternative measure of risk, specified as the average reserves over the confidence interval higher than P90, for quantifying reserves downside is presented. In this paper, we will highlight the appropriateness and limits of using the P90 reserves estimate as a measure of the reserves downside. Understanding of the limitations posed by using the P90 value is vital in management of reserves risk. Copyright 2010, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

abstract={A methodology is developed to quantify the financial risk for a multi-unit generation company with bilateral contracts in a competitive electricity market, using Value-at-Risk as a risk measure. A Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to calculate the Value-at-Risk by modeling different pricing scenarios, bids and schedules of generation. An artificial neural network is used to forecast hourly market prices which determine generating unit schedules through a price-based unit commitment method using a genetic algorithm approach. An economic dispatch then determines local generation and purchase schedules using a linear programming solution. The profit and loss distribution that is obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations becomes the basis for Value-at-Risk calculations. Bidding strategies are formulated from a sensitivity analysis of the Value-at-Risk for various market conditions. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={With the advent of an era of the high fossil energy cost and growing environment consciousness, wind power is gaining great favor over other traditional energy sources. Large scale usage of wind energy can significantly reduce the pollutions and carbon emission otherwise caused by fossil fuel. In many cases, with tax incentive, investment in wind energy can also reduce the operational cost of generating companies. One difficulty of integrating large scale wind power is related to the uncertainty in wind power. Unlike hydro energy which is also renewable and intermittent, wind power output is hard to predict precisely due to the indeterminacy in wind speed. The uncertainty not only causes difficulty in scheduling, but also system stability and security concerns in operation. This work proposed a short-term(24 hours) optimal economical dispatch model and developed a risk evaluation method for the short-term operation of power systems with high wind penetration, considering the wind variability. We use the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) algorithm with constraints to solve the dispatch problem above. The Value at Risk(VaR) and Utility function(UF) are used to evaluate the risk and make a optimal tradeoff between the profit and risk for the system operators. The algorithms are tested on the standard IEEE 30-bus power system to validate the applicability. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={As a traditional research method in decision making technology, stochastic dominance with a riskless asset (SDR) is popular in the field of stock selection. Value at risk (VaR) also is a new and popular method in risk management. How to make a balance between revenue and risk in stock selection always receives great attention from stock investors. Firstly, this paper analyzes the features of SDR and VaR. Secondly, this paper lays emphasis on how to combine these methods to choose the best stock. Finally, according to an empirical analysis in some real stock data, the results show that the two methods could be combined together to make stock selection and receive good results.},

abstract={This study deals with the problem of supply chain planning with risk management. A new multi-attribute stochastic programming model is proposed. Demand, supply, transportation, shortage, and capacity expansion costs are considered as uncertain parameters in the supply chain investment decision. To develop a robust model, an additional attribute function is added to the traditional supply chain design problem. This multi-attribute model includes: (i) the minimization of the sum of current investment costs and the expected future processing, transportation, shortage, and capacity expansion costs, and (ii) the minimization of the VaR (Value-at-Risk) of the total future cost risk. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the ability of the proposed model to supply chain planning. © 2010 ASCE.},

abstract={In china's electricity market, the risk of price fluctuation is significant to grid corporations. A historically reality, the electricity price in market is of gathering effects and heteroscedasticity. Furthermore, the key role of grid corporations in electricity market induces that the same scope of rise and down in price have different impacts on them, which called "lever effect". Based on exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity and Value-at-Risk theory, we define the risk factor of price fluctuation and establish price risk early-warning model. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the model complements the conventional methods and has high precision. The model can supervise the market price and conduct warning signals. So the grid corporations can take timely countermeasures. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Analysis of risks is an inseparable part of asset management of power systems. The paper presents the reliable method for risk management of power system carried out for an urban 10 kV network located in Germany. The basis of the method is the operational risk calculation applied in financial and insurance industries. There the popular method for risk calculation is the loss distribution approach (LDA). The LDA is based on estimation of frequency and severity distribution of failure events over one year time horizon. Under LDA, the adequate capital hold against operational risk losses is defined as Value at Risk, which is the quantile of the distribution for the next year annual losses. Especially the proposed approach combines the probability and severity of risk contingencies based on reliability indices of the system assets. The risk indices are finally applied for sensitivity analysis of two particular risk factors, failure rate and maintenance expenditure. In course of asset management the proposed approach and the following sensitivity analysis of risk factors yield to comprehensible recommendations for maintenance activities. ©2010 IEEE.},

The upper-level objective is to solve maximizing social profits and risk problem, the bi-level optimization is the largest power generation company profit optimization. In this paper, we designed heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the complex two-tier optimization. The IEEE 4-bus system and IEEE 9-bus system have been tested. Numerical examples of some standard tested IEEE systems show that the new model and algorithm have better effect of computation and practical. The contrast analysis show that CVaR can more accurately measure the risk of the power suppliers than VaR.},

abstract={This paper reviews current capital budgeting practices and their impact on energy efficiency investments. The prevalent use of short payback ′rule-of-thumb′ requirements to screen efficiency projects for risk is shown to bias investment choices towards ′sure bet′ investments bypassing many profitable efficiency investment options. A risk management investment strategy is presented as an alternative to risk avoidance practices applied with payback thresholds. The financial industry risk management tool Value-at-Risk is described and extended to provide an Energy-Budgets-at-Risk or EBaR risk management analysis to convey more accurate energy efficiency investment risk information. The paper concludes with recommendations to expand the use of Value-at-Risk-type energy efficiency analysis. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The distributions of recurrence intervals for positive and negative thresholds are symmetric, and display power-law tails tested by three goodness-of-fit measures, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, the weighted KS statistic and the Cramér-von Mises criterion. Both longterm and shot-term memory effects are observed in the recurrence intervals for positive and negative thresholds q. We further apply the recurrence interval analysis to the risk estimation for the Chinese stock markets based on the probability Wq(Δt, t), value-at-risk (VaR) analysis and VaR analysis conditioned on preceding recurrence intervals. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract={Risk analysis is becoming actually an important part of asset management of power systems. The paper presents the simple but reliable method for risk management of power system carried out for an urban 10 kV network located in Germany. The basis of the method is the indication of risks by Value at Risk index according to Loss Distribution Approach developed by the insurance and financial industry. The Loss Distribution Approach is based on estimation of the frequency and severity distribution of failure events over a one year time horizon. Especially the proposed approach combines the probability and severity of risk contingencies based on reliability indices of the system assets. The indices are finally applied for sensitivity analysis of two particular risk factors, failure rate and maintenance expenditure. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={The presence of non linear instruments is responsible for the emergence of non Gaussian features in the price changes distribution of realistic portfolios, even for Normally distributed risk factors. This is especially true for the benchmark Delta Gamma Normal model, which in general exhibits exponentially damped power law tails. We show how the knowledge of the model characteristic function leads to Fourier representations for two standard risk measures, the Value at Risk and the Expected Shortfall, and for their sensitivities with respect to the model parameters. We detail the numerical implementation of our formulae and we emphasize the reliability and efficiency of our results in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation. © 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In a competitive market scenario, consumers make payments for the consumption of electricity to retailers at fixed tariff. The retailers buy power at the Market Clearing Price (MCP) in spot market and/or through bilateral contract at agreed upon price. Due to these different modes at buying and selling ends, the retailers are faced with an involved task of estimating their payoffs along with the risk-quantification. The methodology presented in this paper gives a range of bilateral quantity and associated price for a retailer to ensure risk-constrained payoff. The exercise is carried out with a single retailer in the market as well as for a case of competition amongst two retailers. Risk is quantified using Risk Adjusted Recovery on Capital (RAROC). The problem is evaluated to get a range of bilateral quantity to be quoted for a particular bilateral price at fixed tariff of loyal load and fixed value of switching load. This summary combined with risk-averseness of the retailer leads him to make a judicial choice about bilateral transactions such that it leads to a risk-constrained payoff. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we evaluate the value-at-risk (VaR) and the expected shortfalls for some major crude oil and gas commodities for both short and long trading positions. Classical VaR estimations as well as RiskMetrics and other extensions to cases considering for long-range memory, asymmetry and fat-tail in energy markets volatility were conducted. We computed the VaR for three ARCH/GARCH-type models including FIGARCH, FIAPARCH and HYGARCH. These models were estimated in the presence of three alternative innovation's distributions: normal, Student and skewed Student. Our results show that considering for long-range memory, fat-tails and asymmetry performs better in predicting a one-day-ahead VaR for both short and long trading positions. Moreover, the FIAPARCH model outperforms the other models in the VaR's prediction. These results present several potential implications for energy markets risk quantifications and hedging strategies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The offshore insurance industry has traditionally been defined by a "trader" mentality in which companies have been willing to hold risks without attempting to model or further quantify their risk through technical appraisal. The 2005 hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico changed this perspective, and underwriters began to control their exposure to contingent losses through policy sub-limits and other restrictions on coverage. The purpose of the final part of this two-part article is to quantify the losses to property damage in the Gulf of Mexico for historic weather events using the Risk Management Solutions Offshore Platform Model®. Value at Risk measures indicate that the financial exposure of Gulf assets is on the order of $60-70 billion in platform and rig exposures not accounting for pipelines and wells. Probabilistic scenarios from storm simulations indicate a 100-year loss estimated at $5.7 billion and a 250-year loss estimated at $7.5 billion for physical damage to platforms and rigs not including business interruption and operator extra expense losses.

abstract={When an electricity retailer faces volume risk in meeting load and spot price risk in purchasing from the wholesale market, conventional risk management optimization methods can be quite inefficient. For the management of an electricity contract portfolio in this context, we develop a multistage stochastic optimization approach which accounts for the uncertainties of both electricity prices and loads, and which permits the specification of conditional-value-at-risk requirements to optimize hedging across intermediate stages in the planning horizons. Our experimental results, based on real data from Nordpool, suggest that the modeling of price and load correlations is particularly important. The sensitivity analysis is extended to characterize the behavior of retailers with different risk attitudes. Thus, we observe that a risk neutral retailer is more susceptible to price-related than load-related uncertainties in terms of the expected cost of satisfying the load, and that a risk averse retailer is especially sensitive to the drivers of the forward risk premium. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of setting up a Commodities Futures Market in Iran. Specifications for the margin requirements, daily price movement limits, the length of expiration intervals, tick sizes and contract size of various potential future contracts are hereby examined. Saffron, pistachio and rice emerge as the three suitable Iranian agricultural commodities. A new computational method of Value at Risk (VaR) optimization model, using a nonparametric sampling approach, is employed to determine the daily margin requirements and daily price fluctuation limits. Expiration intervals are determined by the simulated daily future price with a minimum of volatility. The daily risk free interest rate and the minimum daily average trading value of a participant in the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) are used as benchmarks to determine the minimum tick size and contract size for each commodity. These contract specifications are the initially suggested quantities for setting up an agricultural futures market in Iran. © 2010, Tarbiat Modares University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this contribution the uncertainties of a biological process model are taken into account explicitly to calculate optimal process trajectories. For this purpose, the initial condition and the uncertainties of the model parameters are described by a weighted sum of normal distributions. Such a so-called Gaussian mixture density (GMD) approximation is propagated through the nonlinear process model to calculate a second order approximation of the statistical properties of the planed process trajectory. A Value@Risk primary objective is used to obtain an optimal process design procedure in presence of uncertainties. In an extensive simulation study a descriptive fermentation process model is used to compare the classical trajectory planning with the robust design approaches. Here, different degrees of approximation complexity and the influence of the weighting factor in the Value@Risk dual objective criterion is investigated. © 2010 IFAC.},

abstract={This study analysed whether the production of high-quality assortments, saw timber and pulpwood in Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands leads to effects of risk compensation. Mixtures of conventionally treated pruned and non-pruned stands, as well as mixtures of stands which had been optimized concerning the occurrence of assortments and financial criteria were considered. The price simulation was done by bootstrapping to avoid the assumption of a certain distribution of timber prices, and to preserve the correlations of the timber prices from different assortments. The financial valuation was carried out with annuities within a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 repetitions. To quantify the effect of natural hazards, the calculations were repeated with and without this factor. Minimum risk portfolios were determined and optimization performed using both a utility function as well as the value-at-risk approach. The mixtures with minimum risk were dominated by pine stands, as they are less affected by natural hazards and prices for pine timber have a lower volatility, although pine timber prices are generally lower compared to that of spruce timber. These pine dominated portfolios showed risk reductions up to 92% compared to the riskiest single stand, but the annuities were reduced even more. In contrast to this, the portfolios optimized with the utility function and the value-at-risk approach consisted of spruce stands. These spruce portfolios showed an efficient risk reduction of up to 60%. Additionally, higher annuities and larger diversification effects occurred in the portfolios containing the optimized stands. Integrating the risk of natural hazards, the annuities decreased, as did the correlation of the annuities of the different stands, while risk increased. Altogether these effects led to higher relative risk reductions when forming optimal portfolios. These results indicate that producing different assortments of spruce and pine leads to risk compensation, especially when considering portfolios consisting of optimized stands. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Due to the stochastic nature of many of the variables involved in energy markets, asset operators, producers and consumers have to deal with a high level of financial risk. Therefore, the positioning with respect to the market is critical for successful trading. Different techniques from financial engineering have been used to manage market financial risks, e.g., Value-at-Risk (VaR) or Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR). In this paper, those risk metrics are presented within a unified approach using reliability-based techniques, which allow obtaining the relationships among them easily. Additionally, First-Order-Reliability-Methods (FORM) are introduced as a tool to compute risk metrics. The proposed method uses standard optimization models to compute risk metrics even in cases that include dependent stochastic variables. Relevant results from an illustrative example are discussed and conclusions are finally drawn. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper presents a methodology for optimal outsourcing of products. Outsourcing of products can have the advantage of reducing the production cost, but often causes a risk that important technology may leak and get used by competitors. To help reduce the risk of intellectual property (IP) leakage, a model proposed in this paper assumes that it is possible to separate some of the important geometrical features on some of the product parts that are outsourced, and then manufacture them in-house. The model estimates the fraction of IP-value that is subject to risk of leakage based on patent claims and how they relate to the outsourced parts and/or features. Production cost is modelled by assuming a base cost for manufacturing parts in-house, and then a discount rate is applied if the decision to outsource is made. Separation of geometrical features from manufactured parts introduces additional cost, which is modelled as an overhead if the decision to separate features is made. The outsourcing management process is then viewed as a two-objective problem, with the objectives being the minimization of both the fraction of IP-value at risk of leakage, as well as the production cost. A case study of an auto-slide-hinge mechanism is presented, in which the two-objective optimization problem is transformed into a single-objective constrained problem. Genetic algorithm is then applied iteratively on the problem in order generate the Pareto-plot that visualizes the trade-offs between the two objectives. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The complementarity of two renewable energy sources, namely hydro and wind, is investigated. We consider the diversification effect of wind power to reduce the risk of water inflow shortages, an important energy security concern for hydropower-based economic zones (e.g. Québec and Norway). Our risk measure is based on the probability of a production deficit, in a manner akin to the value-at-risk, simulation analysis of financial portfolios. We examine whether the risk level of a mixed hydro-and-wind portfolio of generating assets improves on the risk of an all-hydro portfolio, by relaxing the dependence on water inflows and attenuating the impact of droughts. Copulas are used to model the dependence between the two sources of energy. The data considered, over the period 1958-2003, are for the province of Québec, which possesses large hydro and wind resources. Our results indicate that for all scenarios considered, any proportion of wind up to 30% improves the production deficit risk profile of an all-hydro system. We can also estimate the value, in TW h, of any additional one percent of wind in the portfolio. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper addresses the subject matter of the evaluation of distribution network investment plans. Typically the distribution network operators (DNO) evaluate investment plans based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology that establishes the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). In the NPV evaluation, the costs and benefits of a plan have load growth rate and investment costs as primitives. Load growth determines both the evolution of losses and the evolution of network capacity adequacy. Today it is harder to obtain a good forecast on load growth, with the ins an outs of distributed generation, as well a correct estimation of the investment costs, with the increased influence of local authorities to modify planned solutions. In this context, DNOs are increasingly interested in evaluating the risk associated with the variations of both NPV primitives. This paper proposes an evaluation methodology based on the value at risk (VAR) to obtain the worth expected value within a predefined time period and confidence level. The methodology is presented together with an application example that takes into account the DNO's historic error deviations both in load growth and costs.},

abstract={The risk oriented asset management is a new trend for optimization of investments in distribution grids. The approach is based on the derivation of operational risk metrics in accordance with the reliability indices of the system components (or assets) and outage costs. The big challenge of risk assessment methods is to find out the appropriated risk metric which equally reflects the severity and the likelihood of some contingences of considered distribution systems. The wide used metric of risk assessment in the finance and insurance industries as well as nowadays in energy trading is the Value at Risk method (VaR). VaR is the large applied metric for estimation of losses within defined confidence limits and considered time period. The proposed approach is based on the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA) and VaR derivation as measure for risk. Application of LDA and VaR has its roots in a traditional field of insurance risk theory.},

This tool, related to similar capabilities at Sandia, can be used to determine functional requirements for a detection system of aerosol-released threats outdoors. Essential components of OutDAC are a population database, a meteorological dataset, an atmospheric transport and dispersion model and an optimization toolkit. Detector placement is done through optimization against a library of hypothe-sized attack scenarios by minimizing either the mean or value-at-risk of undetected infections. These scenarios are the product of a Monte Carlo simulation intended to characterize the uncertainty associated with the threat. An example case study illustrates that Monte Carlo convergence is dependent on the statistic of interest. Furthermore, the quality of the detector placement optimization may be tied to the convergence level of the Monte Carlo simulation. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Chinese industry stock price index is analyzed and empirical studies on China's industrial risk under different market conditions are made with GARCH-EVT (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity-extreme value theory) VaR (value at risk) model. On the basis of the GARCH model and extreme value theory presented by McNei and other scholars, this paper modifies the above method of risk evaluation and constructs a GARCH-EVT VaR model by applying VaR method put forward by Huisman and others. Taking time-varying property of the risk factor into consideration while constructing the model, this paper models the fat-tail of the risk factor using EVT, thus simplifying the evaluation process of VaR and improving the accuracy of evaluation as a result. The GARCH-EVT VaR model can better describe the tail of the distribution, and more accurately measure the market risk and industrial risk within studied period as well. The results indicate that risks of different industries vary in different market conditions. The above conclusions are validated by using Kruskal-Wallis Consistency tests. It is essential to adjust the distributions of assets in accordance with market conditions and features of industrial risks in the process of access combination management.},

abstract={In an electricity market, suppliers are more concerned with maximizing their profit and minimizing the financial risk, which can be achieved through strategic bidding. In this paper, Equal Incremental Cost Criteria (EICC) has been used for developing the optimal bidding strategy. The rival's bidding behavior has been formulated using a stochastic optimization model. Genetic Algorithm (GA), along with ac sensitivity factors, has been used to decide the optimal bidding strategy including congestion management to maximize the profit of the suppliers, considering single sided as well as double sided bidding. Both pure as well as probabilistic strategies have been simulated. Results with Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), a classical optimization method, and dc sensitivity factors have also been obtained to compare and establish the effectiveness of proposed method. Value at Risk (VaR) has been calculated as a measure of financial risk. © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A new stochastic volatility (SV) method to estimate the conditional value at risk (CVaR) is put forward. Firstly, it makes use of SV model to forecast the volatility of return. Secondly, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and Gibbs sampling have been used to estimate the parameters in the SV model. Thirdly, in this model, CVaR calculation is immediate. In this way, the SV-CVaR model overcomes the drawbacks of the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity value at risk (GARCH-VaR) model. Empirical study suggests that this model is better than GARCH-VaR model in this field. Copyright Protection.},

Similar VaR estimation and prediction are observes under the EVT and heavy-tailed long-memory ARCH approaches. The empirical results evidence the EVT-based VaR are more accurate but only at higher quantites. It is also found that EVT approach is able to provide a convenient framework for asymmetric properties in both the lower and upper tails which implies that the risk and reward are not equally likely for the short- and long-trading positions in Malaysian stock market.},

abstract={It is complementary and inseparable to assess the present market situation and to forecast the development of the market operation. Price is the most direct market signal. The fluctuation of on-grid electricity price in market is of gathering effect and heteroscedasticity. So analysis methods of the financial area are introduced here. Based on generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) and value-at-risk (VaR) theory, the price risk-forecast model was established, which is taking capacity sufficient rate (CRS) and must-run rate (MRR) into account. The model had considered the actual market situation of supply and demand, the structure of generation market and the status of power generation merchant. The empirical analysis illustrates that this model could make up for the shortcomings of conventional methods. Whether static forecast or dynamic forecast, the model can guarantee higher precision. Under the guidance of this model, the electricity market operation and supervisory agencies are able to take timely countermeasures according to the price risk-forecast signal. © 2009 Chin.

abstract={The ORNL-PSerc-Alaska (OPA) model is a blackout model proposed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Power System Engineering Research Center of Wisconsin University (PSerc), and Alaska University (Alaska). Although the OPA model is a landmark study, it has two limitations. First, there is a significant difference between simulation and practice in transmission line outage and update; and second, the simulation of cascading failure and the probability distribution of blackout size are in general not accurate enough. Hence, an improved OPA model is proposed in this paper to address these limitations. The proposed model contains two layers of iteration. The inner iteration describes the fast dynamics of the system and considers the influence of power flow, dispatching, automation, relay protection, and so on. The outer iteration describes the slow overall system evolution and is concerned with the update of the power grid, operation modes and planning. Such a model can be applied to practical large-scale systems. Furthermore, based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), two new complementary blackout risk indices are defined, which reveal critical characteristics of blackouts and are used to evaluate security levels of power systems. The effectiveness of the improved OPA model is verified by the simulations concerning the Northeast Power Grid of China. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Oil and gas companies have successfully developed enterprise risk management (ERM) system to integrate potential financial exposure to extreme risk events, which have devastating after effects. Complex mathematical models such as value at risk (VAR) models are also being used in energy industry to justify risk exposure of traded and physical asset portfolios. The decision-makers are expected to focus their attention on the downside risks to identify and exploit the opportunities that are associated with many uncertain situations. A set of simple scales have been proposed that can be adjusted and updated easily and regularly in response to events, different opinions, or changing environments, or re-assessed from different perspectives in transparent and rigorous manner. An excel workbook also provides an analytical framework with graphical display and the workbook includes tables listing summary risk and opportunity indices and the individual attribute scores for countries.},

abstract={The objective of this paper is describe a new paradigm for the trading of equities. In our formulation, the control corresponds to a feedback law which modulates the amount invested I(t) in stock over time. The controller also includes a saturation limit Imax corresponding to a limit on the value at risk. The admissible stock price evolution p(t) over time is modelled as a family P of uncertain inputs against which we seek robust returns. Motivated by the fact that back-testing of candidate trading strategies involves significant cost and effort associated with computational simulation over sufficiently diverse markets, our paradigm involves the notion of synthetic prices and some idealizations involving the volatility of prices and trading liquidity. Our point of view is that a robust performance certification in this somewhat idealized market setting serves as a filter to determine if a trading strategy is worthy of the considerable time and expense associated with full-scale back-testing. The paper also includes a description of a so-called saturation reset controller. This controller is used to illustrate how the model works in practice and the attainment of robustness objectives over various sub-classes of P.

abstract={A systemic risk evaluation on volatility of dry bulk ocean shipping freight market is proposed to look into shipping properties of long memory and extreme fluctuation. Long memory in dry bulk ocean freight market is measured well based on which a stochastic volatility model is implemented to filtrate the correlation of the daily returns. Then, the focus lies on feasibility of normal distribution hypothesis of freight daily returns and its tailed behavior that makes significant effects on extreme volatility in dry bulk ocean shipping. Moreover, the accurate asymptotical distribution of freight daily returns is constructed and then applied to study the value at risk of dry bulk ocean shipping while extreme volatilities happen. In conclusion the theoretical framework of risk evaluation on extreme volatilities of dry bulk ocean freight market is set up from a few of different viewpoints to make instructive advices for operators and investors who can analyze the market more efficiently and make the decision more rationally.},

abstract={Project value is highly correlated with decisions made during concept comparison and selection. Decisions as such are made amid uncertainty, putting value at risk. This study details a methodology for determining the loss in project value when inaccurate estimates are used during concept comparison and selection. The difference between net present values (NPVs) based on inaccurate estimates and those based on an alternate hypothesis that is assumed to represent the truth determines the magnitude of loss. The value of the information required to reduce uncertainty can then be obtained. An asset development optimization model is used to optimize project NPVs. The model incorporates a number of parameters and variables. Emphases are on the sensitivity of NPV to error in estimates of the statistical properties of two key input variables; initial platform cost and expansion schedule. Results suggest poor estimates have a more marked impact on project value when the function used to describe the cost variable is non-linear. Results also suggest initial platform capacity tends to be too large, typically, due to the aggressive nature of the model when estimates of initial costs are assumed to be cheap. The model acts conservatively when initial costs are assumed expensive and, surprisingly, this also led to excessive initial platform capacity and loss in project value. Conservative schedule estimates also led to sub-optimal initial capacity. Generally, erred estimates of mean values are more detrimental to project value than standard deviations.

abstract={To find an acceptable level of reliability in distribution systems, cost-benefit analysis using customer interruption costs can be applied. In a case study of a test distribution system, investment in cables instead of overhead lines, aimed to increase reliability, is investigated. In addition to considering average values of reliability indices, tools for risk analysis in the financial industry, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Valueat- Risk (CVaR), are also used for the evaluation. Applying these tools allows for extreme events to be given more weight in the investment decision-making process. Even though these kind of events are very infrequent, the consequences are devastating and extreme cases should be included in cost-benefit analysis. By the help of VaR and CVaR the case study shows that cables can cause higher customer interruption costs for some load points in the system during extreme years. © 2008 Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference (AUPEC'08).},

Our objective is to assign appropriate risk contributions to parts of a credit portfolio under a dependent default risk structure. We consider a factor copula approach which has the capability of modeling the default dependent structure while maintaining a balance between tractability and parsimony. Using our proposed formulas, we can calculate the risk contributions and economic capital allocations quickly and exactly. We illustrate our proposed technique via some empirical analysis.},

abstract={We propose a methodology for combining risk management with optimal planning of power production and trading based on probabilistic knowledge about future uncertainties such as demands and spot prices. Typically, such a joint optimization of risk and (expected) revenue yields additional overall efficiency. Our approach is based on stochastic optimization (stochastic programming) with a risk functional as objective. The latter maps an uncertain cash flow to a real number. In particular, we employ socalled polyhedral risk functionals which, though being non-linear mappings, preserve linearity structures of optimization problems. Therefore, these are favorable to the numerical tractability of the optimization problems. The class of polyhedral risk functionals contains well-known risk functionals such as Average-Value-at-Risk and expected polyhedral utility. Moreover, it is also capable to model different dynamic risk mitigation strategies. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a methodology to manage the market risk faced by a distribution company in the emerging electricity market environment. The risk is due to uncertainty in load forecasting, direct power-purchase for large users, and credit default of users. An optimization model that integrates these three kinds of uncertainty is built aiming at minimizing the loss of the distribution company concerned. This model permits the representation of an integrated risk management problem by means of value-at-risk. Under the stochastic programming framework, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility of our approach. © 2008 DRPT.},

abstract={Risk of portfolio of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock market was analyzed by Archimedean Copula. 1 639 groups of data of daily closing prices from 4 January 2000 to 8 November 2006 were chased. First, extreme value model was used to construct the marginal distribution because the financial data has heavy tails and does not have Gaussian distribution. Then, the parameters of the 5 Archimedean Copula were estimated by maximum likelihood method and a better Copula was chosen in order to fit the dependence of the actual data. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation method was chosen to compute the value-at-risk (VaR) and determine the optimal portfolio coefficient. The result shows that when portfolio coefficient is β=0.33, the portfolio risk of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock market is minimized.},

abstract={Value at risk (VaR) is adopted to measure the risk level in the electricity market. To estimate VaR at higher accuracy and reliability, the wavelet variance decomposed approach for value at risk estimates (WVDVaR) is proposed. Empirical studies conduct in five Australian electricity markets, which evaluate the performances of both the proposed approach and the traditional ARMA-GARCH approach using the Kupiec backtesting procedure. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach measures electricity market risks at higher accuracy and reliability than the bench mark ARMA-GARCH approach, as indicated by the higher p values during the Kupiec backtesting procedure. In addition, the new approach also provides more insight into the risk evolution process over time and helps in adjusting VaR estimates to the time horizons that best suit investor interests. The distribution of risk according to investor preferences is shown by decomposing VaR across different time horizons. This also provides important information for the appropriate aggregation of risk measures based on investor investment preferences.},

abstract={This paper proposes an improved model for real option evaluation of generation asset and risk assessment in spot market. A modified mean reversion model with long-term periodic mean, which takes its fluctuation, uncertainties and cyclic characteristics into account, is applied for the description of the electricity price process. System operation constraints are added into the optimization model of GENCOs' active power output. Based on the price process and the optimal output model, generation asset can be valuated by spread real option approach. In the interest of controlling the risks of the investment on generation expansion project, value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR) are used as the risk assessment tools to help the investors making informed investment decision. Numerical simulation experiment on IEEE 30 system is given to show the validity of the proposed method.},

abstract={Financial time series are modeled using quartile regression theory. These models are compared to a least squares regression model in terms of risk measurement. Three conditional quantile regression models were used on dynamically forecast Values at Risk (VaR). The three models used lagged daily returns, weekly virtual variables and lagged means and deviation of return as the predictor variables. The data were taken from Chinese stock market records over the 1996 to 2004 period. In the empirical research the week effect on VaR in the Chinese stock market is investigated. The results show that daily market risk presents typical non-uniformity in a week, and that the quantile regression model is superior to the APARCH model during back-testing. The quantile regression approach estimates VaR for heavy-tailed financial time series at a high significance level. Quantile regression also proved to be an effective semi-parametric approach for measuring market risk and for exploring complex patterns.},

Most of which are focused on the point estimation of VaR. However, in estimating a quantity, a point estimate can be misleading, because it may or may not be close to the quantity being estimated. So we cannot know the accuracy of estimating the quantity. Confidence interval (CI) is one of the most useful manners of quantifying uncertain due to “sampling error”. Besides, the mathematics of interval estimation and hypotheses testing are closely re-lated. Hence, in practical situations, the interval estimation is more preferred than the point estimation. This paper is aimed at applying the extreme value theory (EVT) to evaluate CIs of the VaR of Taiwan weighted stock index. To assess the efficiency of the proposed method in this paper, comparisons with the methods studied in Chang et al. [9] are also made. The empirical results show that the widths of the CIs obtained by the EVT model are narrower than those obtained by Chang et al. [9]. This indicates that the EVT model is more efficient in estimating the VaR of Taiwan weighted stock index than those in Chang et al. [9]. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The theory of copulas provides a useful tool for modeling dependence in risk management. In insurance and finance, as well as in other applications, dependence of extreme events is particularly important, hence there is a need for the detailed study of the tail behaviour of the multivariate copulas. In this paper we investigate the class of copulas being the weighted means of copulas having homogeneous lower tails. We show that having only such information on the structure of dependence of returns from assets is enough to get estimates on value at risk of the multiasset portfolio in ternis of value at risk of one-asset portfolios.},

abstract={The deregulation policy introduces uncertainties into the power market. The power market uncertainties have increased the significance of two factors in decision analysis: financial risks and managerial flexibility. Real Option Analysis enables such flexibility to management. There are several major methods under Real Option Analysis: traditional Black-Scholes Option-Pricing Method, Lattice (Binomial and Trinomial) Methods, Monte Carlo Simulation Method, and Finite Element (Explicit, Implicit, and Crank-Nicolson) Method. This paper concentrates on the lattice method. Lattice model is easy to implement, appreciate and understand. However, when the investment duration is large (or the length of model period - step size is small), the lattice model becomes a massive bush of lattice, which is known as the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a new efficient methodology of solving the curse of dimensionality for the lattice model. The massive bush of lattice model can be reduced by analyzing the boundary of the lattice where the decision changes. This can be achieved via the implementation of value at risk into the lattice model. Besides reducing the degree of dimensionality, this new methodology also specifies "when" a decision changes. This is a very critical part in strategic budgeting planning. Timing and simplification yet maintaining high accuracy in analysis are essential in the new deregulated power economic uncertainties. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={The value at risk (VaR) is a popular method in financial world. VaR measures the worst expected loss over a given horizon under normal market conditions at a given confidence level. This procedure summarizes objectively the exposure to market risk and the probability of adverse move. So VaR measurement can be applied as benchmark of different portfolio, as control instrument for asset owners and as regulation instrument for asset management. The simplicity and objectivity of VaR concludes to the idea, to apply this method for power systems risk management. Basing on the simple example concerning transmission network, a VaR derivation model for power transmission and distribution systems is presented. The discussion concerning advantages of this model in relationship to the conventional reliability methods is closing the paper. ©2007 IEEE.},

abstract={In the deregulated marketplace, generation companies sell energy through auctions in a daily market. The daily-price volatility, together with the bids acceptance process uncertainty, make arise the need of performing risk assessment. A a multi-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming model with linear constraints, able to detect the profitability and risk of bidding in a multi auction energy market, is proposed for power producers. At this purpose, a particularly effective risk measure as the Conditional Value at Risk has been chosen: a discrete formulation has been proposed and evaluated for quantifying the risk of a producer portfolio. The intuitive scenario tree formulation has been adopted to represent the evolution of the random clearing prices and quantities. The Italian zonal pricing has been used as pricing system, to manage network congestions. The proposed model so provides suppliers with an efficient tool able to handle daily market-price uncertainties and to capture, in powerful aggregate risk measures, all relevant portfolio effects of market-risk exposure. Simulations are carried out in a 24-hour time frame on a representative test problem. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposed a new evaluation method to investigate new generation entry in deregulated markets. This method can evaluate the expected net revenue of the new generator when the unit is committed into a trading region in the Australia electricity market. The cumulated annual price and load duration curve are used, together with a randomly distributed bid price profile to determine the loading priority of the candidate unit. The approximated bids stacking priority of the generator enables the computation of the revenue for the new unit. Furthermore, stochastic generator conditions such as outages are simulated with Monte Carlo simulation. Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk are two of the risk assessment tools used to evaluate the risks associated with the commitment of the candidate units. The simulated and historical price data for the trading region of New South Wales (NSW) in the National Electricity Market (NEM) of Australia are used in this study. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Measuring a portfolio's value at risk (VaR) is very difficult when financial returns follow some unknown or non-normal marginal distributions. It is sometimes even impossible to specify the multivariate distribution of two or more returns. In order to overcome these difficulties, a new method based on generalized auto regressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH)-copula model is proposed. Four plate indexes in Shanghai Stock Market, namely industry index (GY), utility index (GG), commerce index (SY), real-estate index (DC) are taken as the single assets of a portfolio. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the VaR of this portfolio is calculated. The result shows that VaR based on Kendall τ correlation coefficient is better than that based on linear correlation coefficient ρ.},

abstract={Considering participators' risk bias, which is measured by the method of value at risk, the risk constraints in a two-echelon supply chain coordination under buy-back contract is equal to giving the order of an upper bound. With a risk-averse dominant enterprise (M) and a risk-neutral non-dominant one (R), the coordination which optimizes the supply chain under the risk constraints is achieved by a penalty mechanism L to reduce R's order. With risk-neutral M and risk-averse R, M can motivate R to increase his order by providing a risk subsidy K, and two cases are discussed. If the risk constraints of R cannot satisfy M's participation constraint to offer K, M will prefer to accept R's order to obtain a sub-optimization solution of the supply chain. Or else, with M's K, R's optimal order just coordinates the supply chain, which is equal to the case without risk bias, and in this situation R's risk bias only affects the profit distribution between the participators.},

abstract={AS information systems (IS) and technology solutions become increasingly service-driven, managers are faced with the task of choosing parameters such as servicelevels, pricing, and contract duration. Information technology (IT) services vendors manage portfolios of contracts in which parameters, decided at inception, are often subject to future risks. The contract profit maximization decision may adversely affect the risk position of the firm's portfolio of services contracts. We propose a model to inform vendors on setting optimal parameters for IS contracts subject to acceptable levels of risk. The analytic model presented draws from IS economics research and the principles of value-atrisk (VaR) from financial economics. We provide examples which illustrate the trade-offs of profit maximizing contractual decisions to portfolio profit-at-risk (PaR). The contribution of this research is the application of VaR analysis to IS contractual decisions and the conceptualization of an economic model of IS service contracts which embeds value-atrisk constraints. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Willful attacks or natural disasters pose extreme risks to sectors of the economy. An extreme-event analysis extension is proposed for the Inoperability Input-Output Model (IIM) and the Dynamic IIM (DIIM), which are analytical methodologies for assessing the propagated consequences of initial disruptions to a set of sectors. The article discusses two major risk categories that the economy typically experiences following extreme events: (i) significant changes in consumption patterns due to lingering public fear and (ii) adjustments to the production outputs of the interdependent economic sectors that are necessary to match prevailing consumption levels during the recovery period. Probability distributions associated with changes in the consumption of directly affected sectors are generated based on trends, forecasts, and expert evidence to assess the expected losses of the economy. Analytical formulations are derived to quantify the extreme risks associated with a set of initially affected sectors. In addition, Monte Carlo simulation is used to handle the more complex calculations required for a larger set of sectors and general types of probability distributions. A two-sector example is provided at the end of the article to illustrate the proposed extreme risk model formulations. © 2007 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract={In mixed pool/bilateral electricity markets, participants can sign forward bilateral contracts several months in advance of its delivery. In addition, generators may sell to and loads may buy from the pool at the spot price through the day- ahead or balancing markets. Forward bilateral contracts have the advantage of price predictability in comparison with the uncertain spot price. However, the risk is that such a contract commits the partners to a price that may be disadvantageous compared to the spot price. Here, we propose a systematic negotiation scheme through which a generator and load can reach a mutually beneficial and risk tolerable forward bilateral contract, either physical or financial. Under this approach, the generator and load respond rationally to a stream of bilateral bids/counter-bids and offers/ counter-offers considering their respective benefits while accounting for the risks incurred by the prediction uncertainty in the pool spot price and other market parameters over the length of the contract. Each negotiating party can choose its own definition of risk which can be influenced by regret, value-at-risk or dispersion from the mean. Numerical tests show that this flexible negotiating approach can be readily put into practice. © 2007 IEEE.},

Based on the estimation of the failure rate distribution certain life cycle cost elements are quantified either deterministically or stochastically depending on their characteristic. The Monte-Carlo simulation is used for the flexible consideration of the entire system and the estimation of risk figures such as the Value-at-Risk.},

abstract={Capacity investment planning is a major decision for a vaccine company. Traditionally, due to the inherent flexibility used in almost all vaccine processes and risk-averse decisions, companies always started with limited capacities, thereby reducing the initial capital investment. However, in order to fulfil fast-growing vaccine demands, good and balanced financial risk management for capacity expansion is required to satisfy future demand without over committing capital. To complement the use of financial risk management, known probabilistic definitions of some classical risk measures such as expected downside risk (EDR), opportunity value (OV), value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are adapted to be used in a scenario-based model for capacity investment planning for manufacture of multiple vaccines. Using these definitions, new models that manage financial risks and aid decisions are developed. Computational results and decision-making analysis methods are also presented and discussed. Numerical results show that this approach enables one to consider and manage the financial risk associated with the different designdjjf\ options, resulting in a set of solutions that can be used for decision-making. © 2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract={Layers of protection analysis (LOPA) is an established tool for designing, characterizing, and evaluating risk in the chemical process industry. Value at risk (VaR) is a method first introduced in the financial sector for modeling potential loss in a complex venture. In this paper we demonstrate the application of VaR principles to the LOPA of an ethylene refrigeration compressor. We calculate the changes in risk profile (probability versus loss) associated with adding or removing different safety interlocks around the compressor. The VaR analysis shows that the benefits of a given layer of protection are not necessarily captured by a single average number, since the entire probability - value curve is affected. This type of analysis will aid in the allocation of limited resources to process risk interventions. © 2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract={Subject to shocks worldwide, the metals markets in the era of structural changes and globalization have seen a very competitive and volatile market environment. Proper risk measurement and management in the metals markets are of critical value to investors belonging to different aspects of any economy due to its unique role as important industry inputs to manufacturing process. Although traditional risk management methodologies have worked in the past, the industry is now facing the challenge of rapidly changing market conditions. Markets now demand methodologies that estimate more reliable and accurate VaRs. This paper introduces wavelet analysis to analyze dynamic risk evolution at a finer time scale domain. As wavelet based VaR estimates provide insights into different aspects of the underlying risk evolution, the artificial neural network technique is introduced to find the optimal weight to ensemble these forecasts. Thus this paper proposes wavelet decomposed nonlinear ensemble approach for Value at Risk estimates (WDNEVaR). Empirical studies are conducted using weekly observations in four major metals markets. Performances of the proposed WDNEVaR and the more traditional ARMA-GARCH VaR are evaluated and compared using Kupiec backtesting procedures. Experiment results confirm that VaR estimates produced by WDNEVaR are considerably more reliable and more accurate than traditional methods..},

abstract={Generators can sell energy in a bilateral market (BM) and a day-ahead auction market (DAM). Their intermediate-term allocation problem is modeled with utility function based upon both BM and DAM. Generator's utility function is composed of expected benefit and trading risk in the two markets. Value at risk is applied to measure the trading risk. Considering constraints of unit operation, the allocating problem can be formed as a bilevel problem and it is solved by genetic algorithm. Optimal allocating strategies for generators with distinct risk-preferences can be obtained through solving the problem across a rage of market conditions. Such models can be used to analyze the allocating strategies quantitatively and to provide assistance to generators with regard to decision-making. Numerical examples are presented based on market data from New England power market.},

abstract={Operating reserve is traditionally determined as a fixed percentage of the peak load or the largest contingency in a system. In this paper, the probabilistic nature of operating reserve is considered. A risk assessment based approach is proposed to analysis the value of operating reserve. In the proposed approach, the value at risk of a power system is first calculated base on Forced Outage Rates of units. Then, according to the values of system outages, the probability of system loss of value is calculated. Considering operating reserve, the reserve value at risk is obtained by comparing the system loss of values with and without reserve at the same risk level. In the study case, data of IEEE Reliability Test System is used to test the proposed approach. © 2006 IEEE.},

Merton structural model and an experienced relation function are applied to evaluate the firm's value. GARCH model is also employed to estimate both the return series and the volatility of the equity. Under this situation, the expected distribution of the firm value and the Value at Risk (VaR) can be obtained based on Monte Carlo simulation. Since the paper may be the first one trying to value the potential risk of firm value, it is very helpful for analyzing mergers and acquisitions in the capital market as well as controlling the risk of asset for those large state-owned asset management companies in China. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={The value of energy trades can change over time with market conditions and underlying price variables. The rise of competition and deregulation in energy markets has led to relatively free energy markets that are characterized by high price shifts. Within oil markets the volatile oil price environment after OPEC agreements in the 1970s requires a risk quantification." Value-at-risk" has become an essential tool for this end when quantifying market risk. There are various methods for calculating value-at-risk. The methods we introduced in this paper are Historical Simulation ARMA Forecasting and Variance-Covariance based on GARCH modeling approaches. The results show that among various approaches the HSAF methodology presents more efficient results, so that if the level of confidence is 99%, the value-at-risk calculated through HSAF methodology is greater than actual price changes in almost 97.6 percent of the forecasting period. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The concentrations of air pollution measured at a single location are dominated by the emission source and the effects of meteorological conditions. Statistical methods offer a fast and fairly accurate approach to analyze extreme air pollution phenomena. Under this prism, perhaps the most suited modeling tool is the Extreme Value Theory (EVT), which is centered on the modeling of extreme changes above a predefined limit. This paper presents the modeling of daily PM10 (airborne particles with aerodynamic diameter <10 μm) concentration values from an industrial area in West Macedonia. The central concept of EVT is the estimation of Value-at-Risk (VaR), which is a measure of the maximum probabilistic change for a selected confidence level (here 95%) from the current air pollution levels. © by PSP 2006.},

Through analyzing the characteristics involving in EP's long-term electricity purchasing problem, a general model based on modern portfolio theory is presented. Detail discussions are focused on electricity purchasing portfolio selection on two commonly existing markets: long-term contract and spot market, in order for discovering the relationship between long-term contract price, contract amount with spot price. When the EP's attitude toward risk is taken into account, the utility function and Value-at-Risk approach commonly used in financial engineering, is applied to determine the allocation portfolio and assess the purchasing portfolio's risk. Finally, according to the separated bidding mode of on peak and off-peak, the simulations are made for selecting purchasing portfolio and assessing the risk of the portfolio. The results show that the research provides a systematic approach on electricity purchasing selection and risk assessment.},

Furthermore we run a Risk Management application on a GRID computing architecture. By estimating a parametric Value at Risk, we show how GRID computing offers an opportunity to enhance the solution of computational demanding problems with decentralized data retrieval. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new approach to risk assessment of strategies based on the Total Time on Test (TTT) transform techniques. A new concept of risk of loss is introduced, whose value is determined by potential losses and corresponding probabilities of all unfavourable cases. It is closely related to the maximum acceptable (cost) value (MAV) set by a decision maker. How to calculate the value of risk of loss for a given strategy and a MAV is described in depth and a final formula is derived. The values of risk of loss of different strategies can be used for comparisons of these strategies in terms of overall potential losses for the purpose of assisting decision makers in choosing a better strategy. The results of this method can provide specific information about the risk of loss of a strategy. Two examples are used to demonstrate the usage of this method. The scaled TTT plot method and this risk of loss method are applied to the example A and the results of both methods agree with each other. In the example B to which the scaled TTT method is not applicable, the risk of loss method can provide reasonable solutions. This new method can be used for other situations in which the TTT concepts are valid. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an integrated framework for the optimal management of electricity purchase allocation and risk for load service entities (LSEs). To the practice of China Power Markets, we propose the framework of power portfolio of combined physical forward contract and spot market. The framework suggests that the forward contracts should have different prices on-peak and off-peak in accord with sale prices distinguish on-peak and off-peak. The optimal purchase problem is described by the utility maximum integrated the rate of return and risk tolerance level, and risk is evaluated by Value at Risk (VaR). The analytical solution is also conducted. The numerical results are reasonable with higher rate of return and better risk hedging compared with the corresponding results from the existing portfolio selection approach. The presented framework gives one possible and effective method for the optimal power portfolio and risk management in incomplete power markets. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, the problem of power plant expansion for electricity generation under risk from demand uncertainty and supply is addressed. We begin with a deterministic model. Then, this model is expanded to a stochastic model by means of considering the various demands for different operation modes as random. After this model is analyzed, a way of quantifying risk using the value at risk methodology (VaR) is proposed. The last model presented is such that randomness in the availability factors is considered. The concepts of Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and Value of Stochastic Solution (VSS) are also studied. The models presented are based on an extended form of the well known stochastic programming and chance constrained programming.},

abstract={In electric power markets, power plants become one of the main players and they are facing different choices of supply markets. Different markets have unique fluctuating characters of market prices and revenue rate. The power producer will decide the proportional electricity supply in different markets for a bidding strategy of the annual total electricity supply. The power portfolio strategy is to maximize the annual profit under the lowest level of bidding risks and under the restriction of exceeding the minimum expected annual profit. Risks measurement and management techniques, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), proposed in financial research field recently are introduced in this paper to build a portfolio optimization model with CVaR risk minimization for power producers in electricity markets. The mathematical model is discussed, the solution is given out and then the model is applied into a simulation scenario to verify its efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CVaR based risk measurement and decision model for generators can be efficiently adopted to give out the optimal allocation of bidding generation in different markets. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper addresses a dynamic portfolio investment problem. It discusses how we can dynamically choose candidate assets, achieve the possible maximum revenue and reduce the risk to the minimum level. The paper generalizes Markowitz's portfolio selection theory and Sharpe's rule for investment decision. An analytical solution is presented to show how an institutional or individual investor can combine Markowitz's portfolio selection theory, generalized Sharpe's rule and Value-at-Risk (VaR) to find candidate assets and optimal level of position sizes for investment (dis-investment). The result shows that the generalized Markowitz's portfolio selection theory and generalized Sharpe's rule improve decision making for investment.},

abstract={Competition in power markets exposes companies which participate to physical and financial uncertainties. Generator companies, bidding to supply power in day-ahead markets may face forced outages after bids are accepted by the system operator. When this happens they have to buy power from the real-time hourly spot market and sell to the ISO at the set day-ahead market clearing price. This paper shows simulations of random forced outages for generators and the resulting risk profiles of generators. Value at Risk (VaR) is calculated at 98% confidence level as a measure of financial risk. The risk profiles and the VaR of the generators are changed with changes in bidding functions. The simulations do not consider transmission limits or demand side bidding. © 2005 IEEE.},

abstract={Value at risk (VaR) has become a standard measure of portfolio risk over the last decade. It even became one of the corner stones in the Basel II accord about banks' equity requirements. Nevertheless, the practical application of the VaR concept suffers from two problems: how to estimate VaR and how to optimize a portfolio for a given level of VaR? This application to bond portfolios shows that a solution to the two aforementioned problems gives raise to a third one: the actual VaR of bond portfolios optimized under a VaR constraint might exceed its nominal level to a large extent. Thus, optimizing bond portfolios under a VaR constraint might increase risk. This finding is of relevance not only for investors, but even more so for bank regulation authorities.

abstract={Power generator is one of the participants in a power market, who can select different ways to trade electric energy. Generator can sell energy in bilateral market and day-ahead auction market including the spot energy market and ancillary service market. Therefore they are confronted with a new problem: how to allocate their limited power to the markets in order to maximize their benefit while reducing the related risk. With a consideration of unit operation constraints and the market risk, a long-term trading model is presented. The optimal allocating strategies of generators with distinct risk-preference can be achieved through solving the problem with genetic algorithm under the same market conditions, at the same time the optimal allocating strategies of one generator with different market conditions can be developed. This paper can be used to analyze the allocating strategies quantitatively and provides the criterion for generators' allocating decision.},

abstract={Competition in power markets has exposed the participating companies to physical and financial uncertainties. A random outage after acceptance of bids by the ISO forces a generator to buy power from the real-time hourly spot market and sell to the ISO at the set day-ahead market clearing price, incurring losses if the real-time hourly spot market is expensive. This paper assesses the financial risk of the generators using risk profiles and VaRs. A risk minimization module is developed which derives optimum bidding strategies of the generator company such that the estimated total earning is maximized keeping the VaR below a tolerable limit.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) estimation technique for dynamic hedging and investigate the effect of higher order moments in the underlying on the hedging loss distributions. At first, we approximate the underlying stock process through its first four moments including skewness and kurtosis using a general parameterization of multinomial lattices, and solve the mean square optimal hedging problem. Then our recently developed technique is applied to extract the hedging loss distributions in option hedge positions. Finally, we demonstrate how the hedging error distribution changes with respect to non-zero kurtosis and skewness in the underlying through numerical experiments, and examine the relation between VaR and CVaR of the hedging loss distributions and kurtosis of the underlying.},

Each forecasting model is applied to a financial data set that includes the S&P 500, ten year U.S. government bond series, crude oil prices, and the foreign currency exchange rate between the Canadian and U.S. dollar. Forecasts are evaluated using MSE, MAD, U, DM, regression test, LINEX, and Value at Risk (VaR). Overall these forecast summary statistics show that for each financial series, the GARCH models and TARCH model in particular to be better than the stochastic volatility model (SV) in almost every category except MAD. Value at risk calculated from the SV model does not reject independence in three of the four financial series studied but does reject unconditional coverage in all of the series studied. All of the parametric models reject conditional coverage. The conditional empirical density model does not reject conditional coverage in three of the four series studied. In general, the conditional empirical density model is preferred to many other VaR models.},

abstract={An increasing emphasis on chemical process safety over the last two decades has led to the development and application of powerful risk assessment tools. Hazard analysis and risk evaluation techniques have developed to the point where quantitatively meaningful risks can be calculated for processes and plants. However, the results are typically presented in semi-quantitative "ranked list" or "categorical matrix" formats, which are certainly useful but not optimal for making business decisions. A relatively new technique for performing valuation under uncertainty, value at risk (VaR), has been developed in the financial world. VaR is a method of evaluating the probability of a gain or loss by a complex venture, by examining the stochastic behavior of its components. We believe that combining quantitative risk assessment techniques with VaR concepts will bridge the gap between engineers and scientists who determine process risk and business leaders and policy makers who evaluate, manage, or regulate risk. We present a few basic examples of the application of VaR to hazard analysis in the chemical process industry.},

abstract={Bank for International Settlements (BIS) proposes that all banks calculate and report amount of market risk they incur and allocate sufficient amount of capital starting at the beginning of year 2002. BIS also suggests that value-at-risk (VaR) models in computing market risk should be used. The Turkish Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency already required all Turkish banks to compute and periodically report market risk and reserve adequate amount of capital since January, 2002. This study mimics an average trading marketable securities portfolio subject to market risk of the four largest Turkish banks. The publicly available quarterly financial reports of year 2001 for Isbank, Garanti, Yapi Kredi and Akbank are examined, and a mimicking portfolio composition is determined as bond investments; 60% in Turkish currency (TRL), 20% in American dollar (USD) and 20%in Euro (EUR). The VaR amounts of the mimicking portfolio are computed by applying Historical Simulation, Monte Carlo Simulation, Delta-Normal and Standard Methods. Finally, stress test is applied for each of the models by using crisis scenarios. The Turkish financial crises of November 2000 and February 2001 are simulated as stress scenarios. The results of stress testing reveal that all methods except standard method can stand the crisis in November 2000, but none of the models can stand the crisis in February 2001. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Regarding the risk measure in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets as a research object, collecting closing index of each day in S-S market over recent 5 years, and using the common variance-covariance and historical simulation method of calculating VaR (value at risk), the feasibility and maneuverability of using VaR technique for calculating risk of the stock market were demonstrated. Compared with traditional methods, it has distinct merits of simpleness and easiness in quantitating the investment risk. Through adopting EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) method, the capability of VaR technique in describing variety of stock market's yield was investigated. The result shows that VaR value basically covers most exchange day's loss, reduces the ghosting effect effectively, and catches the fluctuant assemble, and the effectiveness of VaR technique is validated. The results that the VaR value in financial asset portfolio is less than in the individual financial product indicate that the VaR technique in measuring stock market's risk accords with the basic idea of modern portfolio theory.},

abstract={This paper studies the credit risks faced by the providers of financial transmission rights (FTRs) The introduction of FTRs in different systems in the USA must be viewed in relationship to the organization of the market Often, private players own the central grid, while an independent system operator (ISO) operates the grid. The revenues from transmission congestion collected in the day-ahead and balancing markets should give the ISO sufficient revenues to cover the costs associated with providing FTRs. This can be ensured if the issued FTRs fulfill the simultaneous feasibility test described by Hogan. We study this test on a three-node network under different assumptions and find the maximum volumes which can be sold, including contingency constraints. Next we analyze the feasibility test when taking into account the FTR prices, and demonstrate that a higher volume might be issued. We introduce uncertainty under different scenarios for locational prices and calculate the maximum provided volumes. As a tool for risk management the provider of the FTRs can use the Value at Risk approach. Finally we discuss provision of FTRs by private parties. © 2003 IEEE.},

abstract={Long-term energy market models can be used to examine investments in production technologies, however, with market liberalisation it is crucial that such models include investment risks and investor behaviour. This paper analyses how the effect of investment risk on production technology selection can be included in large-scale partial equilibrium models of the power market. The analyses are divided into a part about risk measures appropriate for power market investors and a more technical part about the combination of a risk-adjustment model and a partial-equilibrium model. To illustrate the analyses quantitatively, a framework based on an iterative interaction between the equilibrium model and a separate risk-adjustment module was constructed. To illustrate the features of the proposed modelling approach we examined how uncertainty in demand and variable costs affects the optimal choice of production technologies.},

abstract={The market risks encountered by energy asset operators can be categorized as short term/operational, intermediate term/trading, and long term/valuation in nature. This paper describes how the market risks in operations can be measured and managed using real option models and stochastic optimization techniques. It then links these results to intermediate term value at risk and related risk metrics such as cash flow, earnings, and credit risk which can be used to measure trading risks over weeks to months; and how to optimize these portfolios for risk-return relationships. Finally, it then explores the risks in longer term energy portfolio management and how these can be simulated, measured, and optimized.},

abstract={The first part of the presentation is on a comprehensive price-based unit commitment (PBUC) formulation. It is perceived that GENCOs would use PBUC to schedule their generating units on short-term, and determine optimal bids for energy and ancillary services in order to maximize their profits. PBUC is a mixed integer program, which considers the characteristics of individual units, and is solved based on the augmented Lagrangian relaxation. The input to PBUC will also include market price forecasts. The output of PBUC will identify the on/off schedules of available generating units within the scheduling horizon. The PBUC solution will be for multiple products (energy and ancillary services portfolio) and will consider bidding in multiple markets. The second part of the presentation encompasses generation asset valuation and value-at-risk (VaR) for measuring the risk of committing the generating assets. The asset valuation problem is formulated as a multi-stage problem and VaR is used as an index for measuring risk. The presumption in this study is that there are hourly markets for both electricity and fuel with fluctuating prices. A Monte Carlo simulation is used for modeling different pricing and generation scenarios and calculate VaR for minimizing the financial risk of GENCOs for supplying the generation to the market.},

abstract={In this paper, we employ convex optimization techniques to compute upper and lower bounds on the tail of an unknown probability distribution given its first m moments. We then apply this to dynamic hedging problems, where we estimate a specific quantile of the wealth balance (hedging error) distribution, known as its Value-at-Risk. A backward recursive algorithm on a multinomial lattice is used to compute the required moments of the wealth balance. Combining this with the convex optimization probability bounds results in an efficient methodology for estimating the risk resulting from a dynamic hedge.},

abstract={A proof of convergence is presented for a simplified numerical integration method for solving systems of correlated stochastic differential equations describing mean reverting geometric Brownian motion. Such systems arise in modelling the time evolution of interest rate term structures. For time discretization of size Δt, the method leads to global error in time of O (Δt 2) and no error accumulation. The result is shown to extend to the case when principal components analysis is used to reduce the number of underlying stochastic factors. © 1999, Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.},
