<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="firm-challenge">Firm Challenge</h2>
<p>Funds-Axis is a leading provider of investment compliance monitoring, risk and regulatory reporting solutions to the global investment management industry. They offer a unique combination of highly efficient and secure, multi-modular technology and expert regulatory support and service delivered through their cloud based platform.</p>
<p>There is a growing regulatory push for investment managers to adopt more advanced quantitative risk solutions for the majority of investment funds, however, it is currently accepted within the investment management industry that Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Risk Analytics, despite their usefulness, are complex and expensive and cannot be made available for all investment funds at an accessible pricing point. Through this Innovation Voucher we hope to be able to challenge this. Funds-Axis’ current platform does not offer a quantitative risk model solution, through this Innovation Voucher we aim to research a cutting-edge intellectually robust, scalable solution in the main areas of focus of Value-at-Risk and Risk Analytics. The demand for this solution is there from Funds-Axis’ existing client base, and by developing a proprietary risk they will ensure that we are ready to meet client and wider sectoral needs.</p>
<p>Funds-Axis strives to provide their customers with cost-effective best-of-breed regulatory technology, and recognises that in order to do so the company must innovate to ensure high levels of efficiency and automation in their products and services. The innovation to the company would lie in providing a bundled solution at scale at a new market price point. To achieve this, Funds-Axis need to be able to develop complex proprietary statistical modules and deploy them at scale using advanced cloud computing techniques. The skills required are a blend of leading edge quantitative financial, financial modelling, and statistical capabilities such as machine learning methods for risk modelling. The application of machine learning techniques in the context of risk measurement is an emerging and less developed area.</p>
<p>By adding a risk solution to their portfolio, at a potentially market disrupting price point, will provide Funds-Axis further differentiation from the competition. The vision is that the developed solution would be routinely recognised as an accepted go-to solution for retail investment funds that require a Value-at-Risk solution for their regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>Funds-Axis would like to develop the capability to offer a bespoke Risk Analytics platform to their existing client base and to develop new product lines. Specifically, they would like to exploit the latest advances in financial machine learning and computer age statistical inference for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tail risk analytics and VaR modelling</li>
<li>Scenario risk analytics</li>
<li>Stress testing risk analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>Funds-Axis have considered out of the box products but have found them to be unsatisfactory and would like to develop predictive risk analytics capabilities by exploiting the latest innovations in financial analytics technologies and AI.</p>
<h2 id="industry-background">Industry Background</h2>
<p>The global investment management industry is worth approximately $111 trillion, with c. 45% in retail mutual funds. There are c. 125,000 mutual funds globally. Funds-Axis key focus is on c. $20 trillion of these assets in c. 30,000 mutual funds in Europe. All of these require the Investment Compliance, Risk and Regulatory Reporting Solutions provided by Funds-Axis. The investment management industry currently restricts the use of Value-at-Risk (VaR) modelling and risk analytics to approx. 5-10% of their portfolios as the associated costs are prohibitive. Pressure is mounting from global regulators for widespread use of advanced quantitative risk modelling across all investment portfolios, and as such, a rapid growth in demand for VaR and Risk Analytics over the next 5 years is expected. Funds-Axis’ current platform does not offer a quantitative risk model solution; they recognise that in order to respond to existing clients and wider sectoral needs and demands, as well as remaining ahead of competitors, it is strategically important to expand the product portfolio to include VaR and Risk Analytics solutions. By developing a cutting-edge, intellectually robust, and scalable bundled Risk and VaR solution, suitable for approx. 90% of portfolios at a new market price point, they know that significant commercial gains can be made, as they will be able to release a new premium bundled solution to their existing clients with immediate revenue returns.</p>
<p>This Innovation Voucher will form a partnership that will explore and embed expertise in the latest risk analytics and financial machine learning (ML) research with a view to delivering a state-of-the-art risk and scenario analytics platform for Funds-Axis. This requires a combination of expertise in leading edge quantitative financial, financial modelling, and statistical capabilities such as ML methods for risk modelling; skills that Funds-Axis do not have in-house. Risk modelling is complex and requires specialist knowledge in financial ML, tail risk theory and regulation, and computer age statistical inference which can be provided by the Innovation Voucher team from Queen’s University Belfast. ML is becoming an established tool in quantitative finance, however, in the context of risk measurement ML is a less developed area i.e. out-of-the-box ML algorithms which are routinely used in financial applications, perform poorly in risk modelling.</p>
<p>The models that Funds-Axis seek to develop will ultimately be subject to intellectual challenge and therefore need to be comprehensive, robust, fit for purpose and academically sound so that they can withstand scrutiny. Partnering with academic experts, will ensure that this challenge will be met, and future seminars and publications to industry stakeholders will convince the community that the solution has been created using a robust and rigorous scientific approach.</p>
<h2 id="review-off-the-shelf-solutions">Review off-the-shelf solutions</h2>
<p>In this section we seek to review existing VaR products on the market and a replication exercise to determine a risk performance baseline. Approximately 5% of the industry currently use VaR and Risk solutions. Currently VaR and Risk Analytics are only required by more complex investment portfolios (e.g. using leverage and derivatives etc.), therefore Risk and VaR analytics are typically provided at high cost and as part of an unbundled standalone service. Funds-Axis offer on request Risk and VaR to a small number of portfolios, which make up c. 5% of the portfolios we manage. Direct competitors include: Bloomberg, FIS, MSCI Risk Metrics, Confluence Statpro and RiskSystems.</p>

assets simultaneously, extending Taylor (2019). We generalize the Multivariate Asymmetric Laplace (MAL) joint quantile regression of Petrella and Raponi (2019) to a time-varying setting, which allows us to specify a dynamic process for the evolution of both the VaR and ES of each asset. The proposed methodology accounts for the dependence structure among asset returns. By exploiting the properties of the MAL distribution, we propose a new portfolio optimization method that minimizes portfolio risk and controls for well-known characteristics of financial data. We evaluate the advantages of the proposed approach on both simulated and real data, using weekly returns on three major stock market indices. We show that our method outperforms other existing models and provides more accurate risk measure forecasts than univariate methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","This study investigates how the relation between value-at-risk (VaR) and expected returns differs under different mispricing statuses. We find that a significantly negative VaR-return relation, defined as the VaR effect, is observed only for overpriced stocks, but not for underpriced stocks. Moreover, VaR has an amplification effect on mispricing, indicating that VaR captures risk that deters arbitrage and thus leads to an increase in mispricing. Our results are robust to alternative VaR definitions, subperiod analysis, different market states, and after controlling for other firm characteristics, well-known risk factors, and those variables that have been shown to have amplifying effects on mispricing. Finally, this study also examines the pricing effect of short sale constraints on the VaR effect under different mispricing statuses. Our findings suggest that the VaR effect observed in overpriced stocks becomes more severe as short sales are more constrained. © 2021","We investigate the extent to which a parsimonious measure of maximum likely loss that captures the tail risk of returns—known as value-at-risk (VaR)—explains the relationship between accruals and the cross-sectional dispersion of expected stock returns. We construct portfolios based on Sloan’s (Account Rev 71(3):289–315, 1996) total accruals (TA) measure and individual asset-level VaR, which reflects the dynamic behavior of the asset distribution. We document that VaR is in congruence with portfolio-level accruals and that there is a significant positive relationship between VaR and the cross-section of portfolio returns. Allowing a double-sort involving VaR and TA further suggests that the spread between low- and high-TA portfolios is significantly attenuated after controlling for VaR. We also conduct a firm-level cross-sectional regression analysis and demonstrate that the TA- and VaR-based characteristics—but not the factor-mimicking portfolios—are compensated with higher expected returns, and that VaR neither subsumes nor is subsumed by TA. Finally, our cross-sectional decomposition analysis suggests that the firm-level VaR captures at least 7% of the accrual premium even in the presence of size and book-to-market. These findings lend support for the mispricing explanation of the accrual anomaly. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","This study investigates the impact of both social and news sentiments indices on the dynamic stock–bond correlation across wavelet-based time-scales over the period 1998–2016. Our results show that the news sentiments namely unemployment, tsunami and sanctions exhibit significant effects during expansion at the shortest time-scale of [2–4] days. These predictors remain significant with reverse signs during recession on the long investment horizon. Yet, the predictability of social media sentiments differs from that of news sentiments with the pattern of reversal in sign also presents for some proxies including windstorm and investment flows. Statistically, our further analysis confirmed the predictability of the sentiments out-of-sample. Excluding the news and social media sentiment effects has also resulted in minimizing the value-at-risk of the (40/60) stock/bond portfolios the most at the investment horizon of [32–64] days during recessions. Our results remain the same after performing some robustness checks. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Modeling the volatility of oil prices is extremely crucial from a risk management perspective. Value-at-risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), the two most popular measures of risk in financial markets, are dependent on the volatility of the oil prices. In this study, Pearson Type-IV and Johnsons Su distributions are explored as two alternate distributions with characteristics, such as asymmetry and heavy tail, to model the volatility and forecast VaR/ES. The estimation is carried out under endogenously determined structural breaks from the data. Various Backtesting methodologies are employed to test the efficacy of the forecasts. The empirical results obtained show that the models with Pearson's Type-IV and Johnson's Su distributions outperform other fat-tailed distributions and the normal distribution especially at the 1% (for long positions) and 99% (for short positions) level. This has policy implications for the oil producing companies, market participants, regulators in the energy sector and the government in general. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","This paper investigates a conditionally dynamic asymmetric structure in correlations when multivariate time series follow a hysteretic autoregressive GARCH process that exhibits nonlinear switching in mean, volatility, and correlation. The hysteresis variable in the proposed model controls regime switching and time-varying delay. This new model allows for distinct responses to negative return shocks, as it can flexibly explore the possibility of asymmetry in the conditional correlation of two target variables. We employ an adaptive Bayesian MCMC method for the parameter estimation and quantile forecasting, which includes value-at-risk and volatility. We conduct backtesting to measure the effectiveness of value-at-risk forecasting, illustrate the proposed methods by using both simulated and real examples, and jointly measure for industry downside tail risk. Lastly, we evaluate the accuracy of the volatility forecast and determine whether there is persistence of conditional asymmetry in conditional correlation in the target time series. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","We propose and estimate a quantitative model of exchange rates in which participants in the foreign exchange market are intermediaries subject to value-at-risk (VaR) constraints. Higher volatility translates into tighter VaR constraints, and intermediaries require higher returns to hold foreign assets. Therefore, the foreign currency is expected to appreciate. The model quantitatively resolves the Backus–Smith puzzle, the forward premium puzzle, and the exchange rate volatility puzzle and explains deviations from the covered interest rate parity. Moreover, the model implies both contemporaneous and predictive relations between proxies of leverage constraint tightness and exchange rates. These implications are supported in the data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","For modeling multivariate financial time series a single factor copula model with stochastic volatility margins is proposed. It generalizes single factor models based on the multivariate normal distribution by allowing for symmetric and asymmetric tail dependence. A joint Bayesian approach using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) within Gibbs sampling is developed. Thus, the information loss caused by the two-step approach for margins and dependence is avoided. Further, the Bayesian approach is tractable in high dimensional parameter spaces in addition to uncertainty quantification through credible intervals. By introducing indicators for different copula families the copula families are selected automatically in the Bayesian framework. In a first simulation study the performance of HMC for the copula part is compared to a procedure based on adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling within Gibbs sampling. It is shown that HMC considerably outperforms this alternative approach in terms of effective sample size per minute. In a second simulation study satisfactory performance is seen for the full HMC within Gibbs procedure. The approach is illustrated for a portfolio of financial assets with respect to one-day ahead value at risk forecasts. Comparison to a two-step estimation procedure and to relevant benchmark models, such as a multivariate factor stochastic volatility model, shows superior performance of the proposed approach. © 2021 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics","The widely used Poisson count process in insurance claims modeling is no longer valid if the claims occurrences exhibit dispersion. In this paper, we consider the aggregate discounted claims of an insurance risk portfolio under Weibull counting process to allow for dispersed datasets. A copula is used to define the dependence structure between the interwaiting time and its subsequent claims amount. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to compute the higher-order moments of the risk portfolio, the premiums and the value-at-risk based on the New Zealand catastrophe historical data. The simulation outcomes under the negative dependence parameter θ, shows the highest value of moments when claims experience exhibit overdispersion. Conversely, the underdispersed scenario yields the highest value of moments when θ is positive. These results lead to higher premiums being charged and more capital requirements to be set aside to cope with unfavorable events borne by the insurers. © 2021 by the authors.

We investigate the risk connectedness using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) measure within a network composed of the top 20 global energy companies recognized by the Platts global energy company rankings, using the Diebold and Yilmaz's (2014) approach. We manage to identify the top risk contributors to the system across companies, regions and industries, and construct a total systemic risk index (TSRI) of the energy system. We further investigate which risk factors play a role in driving the evolution of the TSRI, again from a network perspective. The results show that its dynamics are mainly driven by the US stock market volatility and investors' sentiment in the financial market over the full sample, while energy market risks and exchange rate movements exert significant but short-term influences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","This paper presents a new volatility model which extends the nonstationary nonparametric volatility model of Han and Zhang (2012) by including an ARCH(1) component. This model also allows the errors to be independent and follow an unknown distribution. A Bayesian sampling algorithm is presented to estimate the ARCH coefficient and smoothing parameters. Empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms its competitors under several evaluation criteria. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","The appropriate choice of a threshold level, which separates the tails of the probability distribution of a random variable from its middle part, is considered to be a very complex and challenging task. This paper provides an empirical study on various methods of the optimal tail selection in risk measurement. The results indicate which method may be useful in practice for investors and financial and regulatory institutions. Some methods that perform well in simulation studies, based on theoretical distributions, may not perform well when real data are in use. We analyze twelve methods with different parameters for forty-eight world indices using returns from the period of 2000-Q1 2020 and four sub-periods. The research objective is to compare the methods and to identify those which can be recognized as useful in risk measurement. The results suggest that only four tail selection methods, i.e., the Path Stability algorithm, the minimization of the Asymptotic Mean Squared Error approach, the automated Eyeball method with carefully selected tuning parameters and the Hall single bootstrap procedure may be useful in practical applications. © 2021 by the authors.","The present article deals with intra-horizon risk in models with jumps. Our general understanding of intra-horizon risk is along the lines of the approach taken in Boudoukh et al. (2004); Rossello (2008); Bhattacharyya et al. (2009); Bakshi and Panayotov (2010); and Leippold and Vasiljević (2020). In particular, we believe that quantifying market risk by strictly relying on point-in-time measures cannot be deemed a satisfactory approach in general. Instead, we argue that complementing this approach by studying measures of risk that capture the magnitude of losses potentially incurred at any time of a trading horizon is necessary when dealing with (m)any financial position(s). To address this issue, we propose an intra-horizon analogue of the expected shortfall for general profit and loss processes and discuss its key properties. Our intra-horizon expected shortfall is well-defined for (m)any popular class(es) of Lévy processes encountered when modeling market dynamics and constitutes a coherent measure of risk, as introduced in Cheridito et al. (2004). On the computational side, we provide a simple method to derive the intra-horizon risk inherent to popular Lévy dynamics. Our general technique relies on results for maturity-randomized first-passage probabilities and allows for a derivation of diffusion and single jump risk contributions. These theoretical results are complemented with an empirical analysis, where popular Lévy dynamics are calibrated to the S&amp;P 500 index and Brent crude oil data, and an analysis of the resulting intra-horizon risk is presented. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","This paper aims to compare Bitcoin with gold in the diversification of Chinese portfolios using daily data over the 2010–2020 period. We propose a new development of copula-based joint distribution function of returns to simulate the Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall of portfolios including Bitcoin (or gold) and those without it. The stochastic dominance method is also used to compare the return distributions of the three types of portfolios. Empirical results show that gold is a better portfolio diversifier than Bitcoin as it helps better reduce the risk of portfolios. On the other hand, Bitcoin better increases the return but also increases the risk. The stochastic dominance results further show that portfolios diversified by gold dominate those diversified by Bitcoin. Based on these findings, we conclude that in China, gold is a better portfolio diversifier than Bitcoin for risk-averse investors. However, for risk-seeking investors, Bitcoin can be a better choice. This result is found to be robust to the time, frequency and currency effects. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","This paper investigates the time-varying conditional higher moments of the daily returns on WTI crude oil futures, using the GJR-GARCH model with Gram-Charlier expansion (GCE) of normal density. The empirical results suggest significant time-variations in the conditional skewness and kurtosis. The out-of-sample value-at-risk (VaR) forecasting results show the advantage of models with dynamic higher moments over those with constant higher moments. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","This study examines the direction and extent of asymmetric volatility connectedness between the oil and commodity markets, using five-minute interval data from the oil, natural gas, and 21 commodity futures markets. We also analyze the positive and negative volatility connectedness through network diagrams to determine the magnitude and strength of the volatility spillover. We suggest optimal portfolios for several oil-commodity pairs minimizing value-at-risk and conditional value-at-risk with higher hedge effectiveness. The results are of significant interest to investors and policymakers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","In this paper, we present a novel risk-scaling strategy based on a measure of downside risk and investigate its performance on underlying portfolios that are formed on low-risk anomaly. The downside risk-scaling strategy addresses two challenges of the volatility-scaling strategy, namely, underestimation of and indirect management of downside risk. We demonstrate that our downside risk-scaled strategy improves the unscaled underlying low-risk anomaly strategy as well as outperforms volatility-scaled strategy in terms of risk-adjusted return and various performance metrics that are related to downside events. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Expected Shortfall (ES) is one of the most heavily used measures of financial risk. It is defined as a scaled integral of the quantile of the profit-and-loss distribution up to a certainly confidence level. As such, quantile regression (QR) and the closely related expectile regression (ER) methods are natural techniques for estimating ES. In this paper, we survey QR and ER based estimators of ES and introduce several novel variants. We compare the performance of these methods through simulation and through a data analysis based on four major US market indices: the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the NASDAQ Composite Index. Our results suggest that QR and ER methods often work better than other, more standard, approaches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","This study constructs an extended value-at-risk model that incorporates all microstructural liquidity components using a high-quality tick-by-tick index options market dataset. Out-of-sample backtesting and mean-difference analyses suggest that the traditional value-at-risk measure significantly underestimates investors’ potential losses relative to our new liquidity-adjusted measure. Logistic regressions reveal that ex-ante market illiquidity increases violations of liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk and that these violations are often driven by foreign institutional investors. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This article proposes a simple approach to estimate quantiles of daily financial returns directly from high-frequency data. We denote the resulting estimator as realized quantile (RQ) and use it to forecast tail risk measures, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). The RQ estimator is built on the assumption that financial logarithm prices are subordinated self-similar processes in intrinsic time. The intrinsic time dimension stochastically transforms the clock time in order to capture the real “heartbeat” of financial markets in accordance with their trading activity and/or riskiness. The self-similarity assumption allows to compute daily quantiles by simply scaling up their intraday counterparts, while the subordination technique can easily accommodate numerous empirical features of financial returns, such as volatility persistence and fat-tailedness. Our method, which is built on a flexible assumption, is simple to implement and exploits the rich information content of high-frequency data from another time perspective than the classical clock time. In a comprehensive empirical exercise, we show that our forecasts of VaR and ES are more accurate than the ones from a large set of up-to-date comparative models, for both, stocks and foreign exchange rates. © 2021 The Author(s).

Our time series model is a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model with multivariate normal tempered stable (MNTS) distributed residuals used to capture the non-Gaussian cryptocurrency return dynamics. Based on the time series model, we optimize the portfolio in terms of Foster-Hart risk. Those sophisticated techniques are not yet documented in the context of cryptocurrency. Statistical tests suggest that the MNTS distributed GARCH model fits better with cryptocurrency returns than the competing GARCH-type models. We find that Foster-Hart optimization yields a more profitable portfolio with better risk-return balance than the prevailing approach. © 2021","Forecasting accurate Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimations is a crucial task in applied financial risk management. Even though there have been significant advances in the field of financial econometrics, many crises have been documented throughout the world in the last decades. An explanation for this discrepancy is that many contemporary models are too complex and cannot be easily understood and implemented in the financial industry (Fama in Financ Anal J 51:75–80, 1995; Ross in AIMR conference proceedings, vol. 1993, no. 6, pp. 11–15, Association for Investment Management and Research, 1993). In order to bridge this theory–practice gap, we present a computational method based on the leverage effect. This method allows us to focus on financial theory and remove complexity. Examining the US stock market (2000–2020), we provide empirical evidence that our newly suggested approach, which uses only the most appropriate observation period, significantly increases the accuracy of the Conventional Delta Normal VaR model and generates VaR estimations which are as accurate as those of advanced econometric models, such as GARCH(1,1). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","In this article, we investigate the quantitative risk management of Bitcoin futures by using the GARCH models. We first found that it is crucial to introduce a heavy-tailed distribution into the GARCH models to explain return volatilities of Bitcoin futures. Then, we compare the VaR estimates based on the parametric methods, namely the GARCH model with the normal distribution (GARCH-Normal) and the GARCH model with the normal inverse Gaussian distribution (GARCH-NIG), and the nonparametric method. Our results illustrate that although the VaR estimates based on the nonparametric method are overall accurate and even more accurate than the VaR estimates based on the GARCH-Normal model, the VaR estimates based on the GARCH-NIG model perform the best. Overall, we conclude that the GARCH-NIG model could generate accurate VaR estimates for the Bitcoin futures return series. In addition, we found that in contrast to Bitcoin cash, the return volatilities of the Bitcoin futures do not increase by more in response to positive shocks than in response to negative shocks. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Advances in the various realized GARCH models have proven effective in taking account of the bias in realized volatility (RV) introduced by microstructure noise and non-trading hours. They have been extended into nonlinear or long-memory patterns, including the realized exponential GARCH (EGARCH), realized heterogeneous autoregressive GARCH (HAR-GARCH), and realized threshold GARCH (TGARCH) models. These models with skew Student's t-distribution are applied to quantile forecasts such as Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall of financial returns as well as volatility forecasting. Parameter estimation and quantile forecasting are built on Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods. Backtesting measures are presented for both Value-at-Risk and expected shortfall forecasts and employ two loss functions to assess volatility forecasts. Results taken from the S&amp;P500 in the U.S. market with approximately 5-year out-of-sample periods covering the COVID-19 pandemic period are reported as follows: (1) The realized HAR-GARCH model performs best in respect of violation rates and expected shortfall at the 1% and 5% significance levels. (2) The realized EGARCH model performs best with regard to volatility forecasts. © 2021 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics","Research on scaling analysis in finance is vast and still flourishing. We introduce a novel statistical procedure based on the generalized Hurst exponent, the Relative Normalized and Standardized Generalized Hurst Exponent (RNSGHE), to robustly estimate and test the multiscaling property. Furthermore, we introduce a new tool to estimate the optimal aggregation time used in our methodology which we name Autocororrelation Segmented Regression. We numerically validate this procedure on simulated time series by using the Multifractal Random Walk and we then apply it to real financial data. We present results for times series with and without anomalies and we compute the bias that such anomalies introduce in the measurement of the scaling exponents. We also show how the use of proper scaling and multiscaling can ameliorate the estimation of risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR). Finally, we propose a methodology based on Monte Carlo simulation, which we name Multiscaling Value at Risk (MSVaR), that takes into account the statistical properties of multiscaling time series. We mainly show that by using this statistical procedure in combination with the robustly estimated multiscaling exponents, the one year forecasted MSVaR mimics the VaR on the annual data for the majority of the stocks. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","We analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the conditional variance of stock returns. We look at this effect from a global perspective, so we employ series of major stock market and sector indices. We use the Hansen's Skewed-t distribution with EGARCH extended to control for sudden changes in volatility. We oversee the COVID-19 effect on measures of downside risk such as the Value-at-Risk. Our results show that there is a significant sudden shift up in the return distribution variance post the announcement of the pandemic, which must be explained properly to obtain reliable measures for financial risk management. © 2021","Credit ratings are fundamental in assessing the credit risk of a security or debtor. The failure of the Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) ratings during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the massive undervaluation of corporate risk leading up to the crisis resulted in a review of rating approaches. Yet the fundamental metric that guides the construction of credit ratings has not changed. We study the inadequacies of the old metric in simple models of investment and in structured finance portfolio optimization tasks, and we propose a new methodology based on a buffered probability of exceedance. The new approach offers a conservative risk assessment, with substantial conceptual and computational benefits. We illustrate the new approach using several examples and report the results of a structuring step-up CDO case study, with details available in an online Supplement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","We show that expected returns on US stocks and all major global stock market indices have a particular form of non-linear dependence on previous returns. The expected sign of returns tends to reverse after large price movements and trends tend to continue after small movements. The observed market properties are consistent with various models of investor behaviour and can be captured by a simple polynomial model. We further discuss a number of important implications of our findings. Incorrectly fitting a simple linear model to the data leads to a substantial bias in coefficient estimates. We show through the polynomial model that well-known short-term technical trading rules may be substantially driven by the non-linear behaviour observed. The behaviour also has implications for the appropriate calculation of important risk measures such as value at risk. © 2021 The Author(s).

Due to limited distributional information in practice, the joint distribution of agents' random costs is difficult to acquire. The coalition, being aware of the distributional ambiguity, thus evaluates the worst-case value-at-risk within a commonly agreed ambiguity set of the possible joint distributions. Through the lens of cooperative game theory, we show that this coalitional worst-case value-at-risk is subadditive for the popular ambiguity sets in the distributionally robust optimization literature that are based on (i) convex moments or (ii) Wasserstein distance to some reference distributions. In addition, we propose easy-to-compute core allocation schemes to share the worst-case value-at-risk. Our results can be readily extended to sharing the worst-case conditional value-at-risk under distributional ambiguity. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","In this paper, a new generator function is proposed and based on this function a new Archimedean copula is introduced. The new Archimedean copula along with three representatives of Archimedean copula family which are Clayton, Gumbel and Frank copulas are considered as models for the dependence structure between the returns of two stocks. These copula models are used to simulate daily log-returns based on Monte Carlo (MC) method for calculating value at risk (VaR) of the financial portfolio which consists of two market indices, Ford and General Motor Company. The results are compared with the traditional MC simulation method with the bivariate normal assumption as a model of the returns. Based on the backtesting results, describing the dependence structure between the returns by the proposed Archimedean copula provides more reliable results over the considered models in calculating VaR of the studied portfolio. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.","Motivated by the importance of the dependence structure between equity and foreign exchange rates in international financial markets, we investigate whether modelling the dependence structure can help forecast the tail risk of foreign investments. We propose a new time-varying asymmetric copula for modelling the dependence structure and forecasting the tail risk. We conduct backtesting on our tail risk forecasts for 12 major developed and emerging markets. We find that modelling the dependence structure can improve the tail risk forecast and make risk management of foreign investments more robust. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","The relationship between markets has always been a topic of heated debate among scholars from various countries. One of the most important concerns is the need to model the relationships between the crude oil market and other markets. Based on daily return observations from 2018 to 2019, we apply a GARCH-vine-copula approach to probe the linkage between Shanghai crude oil futures, stock, foreign exchange, and gold markets. We find that obvious tail dependencies do exist between these markets. And the crude oil futures market occupies a dominant position. Moreover, when the Shanghai crude oil futures market is taken as the known condition, the links between different markets reduce to some extent. Finally, value at risk results denote that the risk of the Shanghai crude oil futures market is relatively high, but portfolio investment can effectively reduce the risk. Moreover, the model fitting results at different confidence levels have passed the Kupiec backtest, indicating that the model in this paper fits the relationship between these markets well. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","We propose a generalized risk measure for expectile-based expected shortfall estimation. The generalization is designed with a mixture of Gaussian and Laplace densities. Our plug-in estimator is derived from an analytic relationship between expectiles and expected shortfall. We investigate the sensitivity and robustness of the expected shortfall to the underlying mixture parameter specification and the risk level. Empirical results from the US, German and UK stock markets and for selected NASDAQ blue chip companies indicate that expected shortfall can be successfully estimated using the proposed method on a monthly, weekly, daily and intra-day basis using a 1-year or 1-day time horizon across different risk levels. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This article proposes a general framework of a Markov Switching GARCH model with a mixture of truncated Gaussian to model asset returns with price limits in China. Theoretically, while retaining many convenient statistical properties of the Gaussian distribution, the proposed model also assumes a flexible time-varying volatility structure to accommodate the feature of the return data under price restrictions in China, such as the clusters near the bounds (due to the ‘bound effect’). Empirically, we apply the model to eight representative stocks from Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets in China. Lastly, we find that our proposed model dominates the conventional volatility models in terms of Value-at-Risk measures. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This research compares the performance of 10 Value-at-Risk (VaR) models, including pure density models (student’s t, mixture of normal, double gamma, kernel, and GPD) and conditional density models (GARCH-student’s t, GARCH-mixture of normal, GARCH-double gamma, GARCH-kernel, and GARCH-GPD). We employ these models and test their performance in Asian markets, including over the 2008 financial crisis period. Findings show that the density functions used in conjunction with the GARCH models are capable of capturing the high peak, fat-tails, and volatility clustering of returns and can improve the accuracy of VaR forecasts. Furthermore, the proposed GARCH-double gamma provides the best fit for all tested Asian markets, both developed and emerging markets, and for foreign exchange rates markets. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","We propose a tail dependence based network approach to study systemic risk in a network of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). We utilize a flexible factor copula based method which allows to measure the level of extreme risk in a portfolio when dependence is driven by one or several factors. We identify the most ‘connected’ SIFIs based on an eigenvector centrality approach applied to copula-implied dependence structures as ‘central’ SIFIs. We then demonstrate that the level of systemic risk implied by such SIFIs chosen as conditioning factors in the factor copula setup exceeds that which is implied by non-central SIFIs in terms of portfolio Value-at-Risk and the portfolio return under stress. This study contributes to quantification and ranking of the systemic importance of SIFIs which is important for setting adequate capital requirements in particular and stability of financial markets in general. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This paper focuses on weather derivatives as efficient risk management instruments and proposes a more advanced approach for their pricing. An “hybrid” contract is introduced, combining insurance properties, specifically tailored for the region under study and introducing Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) as appropriate measures for the strike price. The numerical results show that VaR and ES are both efficient ways for managing the so-called Tail Risk; further, being ES more conservative than VaR and due to its subadditivity property, it can be seen that seasonal contracts are generally better off than monthly contracts in reducing global risk. © 2020 by the authors.

A Gram–Charlier-like expansion adjusts the moments of interest of a given distribution via its own orthogonal polynomials. This approach, formerly adopted for univariate series, is here extended to a multivariate context by means of spherical densities. Previous works proposed the Gram–Charlier of the multivariate Gaussian, obtained by using Hermite polynomials. This work shows how polynomial expansions of an entire class of spherical laws can be worked out with the aim of obtaining a wide set of leptokurtic multivariate distributions. A Gram–Charlier-like expansion is a distribution characterized by an additional parameter with respect to the parent spherical law. This parameter, which measures the increase in kurtosis due to the polynomial expansion, can be estimated so as to make the resulting distribution capable of describing the empirical kurtosis found in the data. An application of the Gram–Charlier-like expansions to a set of financial assets proves their effectiveness in modeling multivariate financial series and assessing risk measures, such as the value at risk and the expected shortfall. © 2020 by the authors.

We use the common risk measures Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall to define good-deals on a financial market with log-normally distributed rate of returns. We show that the pricing bounds obtained from the Value-at-Risk admit a non-smooth behavior under parameter changes. Additionally, we find situations in which the seller’s bound for a call option is smaller than the buyer’s bound. We identify the missing convexity of the Value-at-Risk as main reason for this behavior. Due to the strong connection between good-deal bounds and the theory of risk measures, we further obtain new insights in the finiteness and the continuity of risk measures based on multiple eligible assets in our setting. © 2020 by the authors.

We analyze extreme dependence and risk spillover between Bitcoin and a sample of precious metal commodities comprising of gold, silver, copper, wheat, platinum and palladium over a sample period of April 2013–January 2018 based on daily data. We test the long memory properties of our sampled assets using ARFIMA-FIGARCH model followed by followed by time varying copula framework. Later we use VaR, CoVaR and ΔCoVaR tests to measure risk spillover and resulting asymmetries. Our results contribute towards the existing literature by reporting the hedging ability of gold for Bitcoin and the effect that have on precious metal returns. In this way our results provide insights in both the direction. Our results also document spillover from Bitcoin to precious metal market however in terms of directional spillover from precious metals to Bitcoin, silver remains insensitive to any downside risk spillover. We also report asymmetries in upside and downside ΔCoVaR values, suggesting that extreme changes in returns in either of the market has the potential to affect extreme returns in the other market. Our results have implications for individual investor and fund managers in formulating an optimal portfolio yielding returns with hedge against extreme downward price movements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","We study how a bank allocates capital across its business units when facing multiple constraints over several periods. If a constraint tightens – be it because of stricter regulation or higher risk – capital flows to the more efficient unit, i.e. the unit offering a higher marginal return on required capital. Relative efficiency helps explain how a policy measure targeting a specific business unit – e.g. imposing requirements for market risk, or ring-fencing lending – spills over to another, seemingly unrelated unit. It also helps explain the bank's response to the tightening of a constraint that is contemporaneously slack but likely to bind later on. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","This paper compares the in-sample and out-of-sample performance of several models for computing the tail risk of one-month and one-year electricity futures contracts traded in the NordPool, French, German, and Spanish markets in 2008–2017. As measures of tail risk, we use the one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES). With VaR, the AR (1)-GARCH (1,1) model with Student-t distribution is the best-performing specification with 88% cases in which the Fisher test accepts the model, with a success rate of 94% in the left tail and of 81% in the right tail. The model passes the test of model adequacy in the 100% of the cases in the NordPool and German markets, but only in the 88% and 63% of the cases in the Spanish and French markets. With ES, this model passes the test of model adequacy in 100% of cases in all markets. Historical Simulation and Quantile Regression-based approaches misestimate tail risks. The right-hand tail of the returns is more difficult to model than the left-hand tail and therefore financial regulators and the administrators of futures markets should take these results into account when setting additional regulatory capital requirements and margin account regulations to short positions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","We forecast portfolio risk for managing dynamic tail risk protection strategies, based on extreme value theory, expectile regression, copula-GARCH and dynamic generalized autoregressive score models. Utilizing a loss function that overcomes the lack of elicitability for expected shortfall, we propose a novel expected shortfall (and value-at-risk) forecast combination approach, which dominates simple and sophisticated standalone models as well as a simple average combination approach in modeling the tail of the portfolio return distribution. While the associated dynamic risk targeting or portfolio insurance strategies provide effective downside protection, the latter strategies suffer less from inferior risk forecasts, given the defensive portfolio insurance mechanics. © 2020 The Authors.

We first study its properties, such as periodic ergodicity, finiteness of moments and tail behavior of the marginal distributions. Then, we develop an MCMC algorithm, based on the Griddy-Gibbs sampler, under various distributions of the innovation term (Gaussian, Student-t, mixed Gaussian-Student-t). To assess our estimation method we conduct volatility and Value-at-Risk forecasting. Our model is compared against other competing models via the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC).

The model explicitly takes into account the Pareto tails of losses and the heterogeneous dependence structures between them. We then derive estimators and provide estimation methods for individual as well as aggregated tail risk, measured in terms of Value-at-Risk and Conditional-Tail-Expectation for very high confidence levels, and introduce also an asymptotically full capital allocation method for portfolio risk. Having access to real-world operational risk losses from the Italian banking system, we apply our model to these data, and carry out risk estimation in terms of the previously derived quantities. Simulation studies further reveal first that even with a small number of observations, the proposed estimation methods produce estimates that converge to the true asymptotic values, and second, that quantifying dependence by means of the empirical network has a big impact on estimates at both individual and aggregate level, as well as for capital allocations. © 2020","A novel approach to inference for a specific region of the predictive distribution is introduced. An important domain of application is accurate prediction of financial risk measures, where the area of interest is the left tail of the predictive density of logreturns. Our proposed approach originates from the Bayesian approach to parameter estimation and time series forecasting, however it is robust in the sense that it provides a more accurate estimation of the predictive density in the region of interest in case of misspecification. The first main contribution of the paper is the novel concept of the Partially Censored Posterior (PCP), where the set of model parameters is partitioned into two subsets: for the first subset of parameters we consider the standard marginal posterior, for the second subset of parameters (that are particularly related to the region of interest) we consider the conditional censored posterior. The censoring means that observations outside the region of interest are censored: for those observations only the probability of being outside the region of interest matters. This quasi-Bayesian approach yields more precise parameter estimation than a fully censored posterior for all parameters, and has more focus on the region of interest than a standard Bayesian approach. The second main contribution is that we introduce two novel methods for computationally efficient simulation: Conditional MitISEM, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to simulate model parameters from the Partially Censored Posterior, and PCP-QERMit, an Importance Sampling method that is introduced to further decrease the numerical standard errors of the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall estimators. The third main contribution is that we consider the effect of using a time-varying boundary of the region of interest. Extensive simulation and empirical studies show the ability of the introduced method to outperform standard approaches. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","This paper calibrates risk assessment of alternative methods for modeling commodity ETFs. We implement recently proposed backtesting techniques for both value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) under parametric and semi-nonparametric techniques. Our results indicate that skewed-t and Gram-Charlier distributional assumptions present the best relative performance for individual Commodity ETFs for those confidence levels recommended by Basel Accords. In view of these results, we recommend the application of leptokurtic distributions and semi-nonparametric techniques to mitigate regulation concerns about global financial stability of commodity business. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Numerous advances in the modeling techniques of value-at-risk (VaR) have provided financial institutions with a wide range of market risk approaches. However, which model to use depends on the state of volatility. We present backtesting results for 1% and 2.5% VaR of six indexes from emerging and developed countries using several of the best-known VaR models, including generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH), extreme value theory (EVT), conditional autoregressive VaR (CAViaR) and filtered historical simulation (FHS) with multiple sets of parameters. The backtesting procedure is based on the excess ratio, Kupiec and Christoffersen tests for multiple thresholds and cost functions. The main contribution of this paper is that we compared the models in four different scenarios, with different states of volatility in the training and testing samples. The results indicate that the best of the models, ie, the least affected by changes in the volatility, is GARCH.1; 1/ with a standardized Student t distribution. Nonparametric techniques (eg, CAViaR with GARCH setup or FHS with a skewed normal distribution) have very prominent results in testing periods with low volatility, but they are worse in turbulent periods. We also discuss an automatic method to set an extreme distribution threshold for EVT models as well as several ensembling methods for VaR, of which the minimum VaR estimate from the best models-in particular, a minimum of GARCH.1; 1/ with a standardized Student t distribution and either the EVT or the CAViaR model-has been proven to give very good results. © 2020 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","In this paper, we test the efficiency of least-squares Monte Carlo method to estimate capital requirements in life insurance.

In this paper, we assess this risk transmission using Value at Risk (VaR) modeling for the US, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, over the period covering January 2004–December 2016. We find that socially responsible stock markets exhibit less risk than do conventional markets in terms of the risk hedging properties induced by the SR screening. Second, contributions to systemic risk vary across market phases and return distribution levels, with a larger contribution and spillover effect during the recent global financial crisis. For example, at the downside of the distribution (CoVaR at 5%), the conventional European index shows the highest contribution to the world market's systemic risk, while the US stock market shows the highest contribution at the upside of the distribution (CoVaR at 95%). This finding is justified by the difference in the risk aversion of investors that varies with the market state as well as the disparities in the development of SR markets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","The relationship between the prices of crude oil and its refined products is at the heart of the oil industry. Crude oil and refined products volatilities and correlations have been modelled extensively using short-memory multivariate GARCH models. This paper investigates the potential benefits from using fractionally integrated multivariate GARCH models from a forecasting and a risk management perspective. Several models for the spot returns on three major oil-related markets are compared. In-sample results show significant evidence of long-memory decay and leverage effects in volatilities and of time-varying autocorrelations. The forecasting performance of the models is assessed by means of three approaches: the Superior Predictive Ability test, the Model Confidence Set and the Value-at-Risk. The results indicate that the multivariate models incorporating long-memory outperform the short-memory benchmarks in forecasting the conditional covariance matrix and associated risk magnitudes. The paper makes an innovative contribution to the analysis of the relationship between crude oil and its refined products providing refiners, physical oil traders, non-commercial oil traders and other energy markets agents with significant insights for hedging and risk management operations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","We consider multiple threshold value-at-risk (VaRt) estimation and density forecasting for financial data following a threshold GARCH model. We develop an α-quantile quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) method for VaRt by showing that the associated density function is an α-quantile density and belongs to the tick-exponential family. This establishes that our estimator is consistent for the parameters of VaRt. We propose a density forecasting method for quantile models based on VaRt at a single nonextreme level, which overcomes some limitations of existing forecasting methods with quantile models. We find that for heavy-tailed financial data our α-quantile QMLE method for VaRt outperforms the Gaussian QMLE method for volatility. We also find that density forecasts based on VaRt outperform those based on the volatility of financial data. Empirical work on market returns shows that our approach also outperforms some benchmark models for density forecasting of financial returns. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Although the maximization of the expected logarithm of wealth induces outperforming any other significantly different strategy, the Kelly criterion implies larger bets than a risk-averse investor would accept. Restricting the Kelly optimization by spectral risk measures, the authors provide a generalized mapping for different measures of growth and risk. Analyzing over 30 years of S&amp;P 500 returns for different sampling frequencies, the authors find evidence for leptokurtic behavior for all respective sampling frequencies. Given that lower sampling frequencies imply a smaller number of data points, this paper argues in favor of α-stable laws and its scaling behavior to model financial market returns for a given horizon in an i.i.d. world. Instead of simulating from the class of elliptically α-stable distributions, a semiparametric scaling approximation, based on hourly NASDAQ data, is proposed. Our paper also uncovers that including long put options into the portfolio optimization, improves portfolio growth for a given level of VaR or ES, leading to a new Kelly portfolio providing the highest geometric mean. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","In financial research and among risk management practitioners the estimation of a correct measure of the Value-at-Risk still proves interesting. A current approach, the multivariate CAViaR allows to provide an accurate measure of VaR modelling the joint dynamics in the Values-at-Risk by capturing the quantile conditional dependence structure to take into account financial contagion risk. The parameter estimates are based on multiple quantile regressions which assume linear combinations of sample quantiles. In this paper we argue that the analysis of multiple time-series aimed to model the time-varying quantile dependence can require non-linear and flexible estimation procedures. To this end, we examine the conditional quantile behaviour of some assets included in the Eurostoxx50 with respect to the quantile of a portfolio representing the market with a new copula-based quantile Vector AutoRegressive approach, and compare the results with the bivariate CAViaR model. Findings show that the copula approach is highly competitive, providing a time-varying model aimed to give a better specification of the Value-at-Risk, especially in terms of loss functions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","Recent literature has proposed a market-based measure to assess the contribution of a single bank to the systemic risk, i.e. the delta conditional value-at-risk (Δ CoVaR). This measure could be useful to control the dynamics of systemic risk as perceived by the market. We estimate the Δ CoVaR of Italian and main European banks over the time span from January 2007 to December 2018 by considering three possible methodologies: (1) the quantile regression; (2) a closed form formula; (3) a non-parametric method. The estimates based on closed form formula do not differ substantially from those of the other two methodologies, moreover they provide more robust results. Furthermore, we compare the ranking derived by the Δ CoVaR with the global systemically important banks (GSIBs) buckets determining additional loss absorbency requirements. We show that there are differences in the ranking defined by the Δ CoVaR and the GSIBs bucket allocation provided by the Financial Stability Board even if the Δ CoVaR seems to be able to divide the good from the bad, from a systemic risk perspective. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Historical crisis events have highlighted the insufficiency of Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a measure of market risk because such metric does not take liquidity into account. Unlike previous studies analyzing with only a single asset, we examine the impact of liquidity on computing VaR forecasts from a portfolio level. To this end, we use multivariate GARCH-t and GJR-GARCH-t models, as compared with univariate models, to seize the liquidity property embedded in individual stock returns and evaluate their accuracy and efficiency in computing VaR forecasts for portfolios with different liquidity levels. The empirical results indicate that computing portfolio VaR forecasts with multivariate models outperform the univariate models for full and subsample periods in terms of accuracy and efficiency evaluations, in particular for less-liquid portfolios. These results suggest the importance of liquidity in computing portfolio VaR forecasts. Ignorance of the impact of liquidity in computing portfolio VaR forecasts might result in inadequate coverage and insufficient market risk capital requirements. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","We evaluate the usefulness of bias-correction methods in enhancing the Vasicek model for market risk and counterparty risk management practices. The naive bias-corrected estimator, the Tang and Chen bias-corrected estimator and the Bao et al bias-corrected estimator are selected to be compared against the benchmark least squares (LS) estimator. Our Monte Carlo experiment shows that the bias-corrected estimators substantially reduce the small sample bias of the LS estimator for the Vasicek model and project much more accurate value-at-risk and potential future exposure estimations. Even if the sample length is as long as 30 years, the improvements are still significant, especially for the cases where the mean-reversion parameter is close to zero. The applications to real data further demonstrate that the small sample bias of the LS estimator cannot be ignored and one should consider bias-corrected estimators for the Vasicek model. © 2021 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","When evaluating the market risk of long-horizon equity returns, it is always difficult to provide a statistically sound solution due to the limitation of the sample size. To solve the problem for the value-at-risk (VaR) and the conditional tail expectation (CTE), Ho et al. (2016, 2018) introduce a general multivariate stochastic volatility return model from which asymptotic formulas for the VaR and the CTE are derived for integrated returns with the length of integration increasing to infinity. Based on the formulas, simple non-parametric estimators for the two popular risk measures of the long-horizon returns are constructed. The estimates are easy to implement and shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. In this chapter, we further address the issue of testing the equality of the CTEs of integrated returns.

This study demonstrates that the mixed signs on the risk coefficient stem from the fact that the excess stock return series is assumed to be stationary with a short memory, which is inconsistent with the downside risk series featuring a long memory process. After we appropriately model the long memory property of downside risk and apply a fractional difference to downside risk, the evidence consistently supports a significant and positive risk-return relation. This holds true for downside risk not only in the domestic market but also across markets. The evidence suggests that the risk premium is higher if the risk originates in a dominant market, such as the US. These findings are robust even when we consider the leverage effect, value-at-risk feedback, and the long memory effect in the conditional variance. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte.

The test compares parameter estimates from a rolling window to those from a historical data set and analyzes the behavior under the null hypothesis of no parameter change. The case of multiple breaks is also treated. In the model, the joint copula is given by the copula of random variables which arise from a factor model. This is particularly useful for analyzing high dimensional data. Parameters are estimated with the simulated method of moments (SMM). We analyze the behavior of the monitoring procedure in Monte Carlo simulations and a real data application.

A new nonparametric framework for estimating this conditional Value-at-Risk is presented. A nonparametric approach is particularly pertinent as the traditionally used parametric distributions have been shown to be insufficiently robust and flexible in most of the equity-return data sets observed in practice. The method extracts the quantile of the conditional distribution of interest, whose estimation is based on a novel estimator of the density of the copula describing the dynamic dependence observed in the series of returns.

It is shown empirically that standard SV models may significantly underestimate the value-at-risk of weekly S&amp;P 500 returns at dates following negative returns and overestimate it after positive returns. By contrast, the general specification proposed provide reliable forecasts at all dates.

The goal is to identify the institutions that contribute the most to systemic risk and that are most exposed to it. We use the CoVaR that considered the systemic risk as the value at risk (VaR) of a financial institution conditioned on the VaR of another institution. Thus, if the CoVaR increases with respect to the VaR, the spillover risk also increases among the institutions. The difference between these measurements is termed △CoVaR, and it allows for estimating the exposure and contribution of each bank to systemic risk. Results allow classifying Tunisian banks in terms of systemic risk involvement. They show that public banks occupy the top places, followed by the two largest private banks in Tunisia. These five banks are the main systemic players in the Tunisian banking sector. It seems that they are the least sensitive to the financial difficulties of existing banks and the most important contributors to the distress of the other banks. This work aims to add a broader perspective to the micro prudential application of regulation, including contagion, proposing a macro prudential vision and strengthening of regulatory policy. Supervisors could impose close supervision for institutions considered as potentially systemic banks. Furthermore, regulations should consider the systemic contribution when defining risk requirements to minimize the consequences of possible herd behavior. © 2019 by the authors.

The focus of the empirical analysis is on the energy sector, which has been designated as one of the four key industries, together with services, food, and telecommunications, targeted for economic development by the Vietnam Government through to 2020. The oil and gas industry is a separate energy-related major industry, and it is evaluated separately from energy. The data set is from 2009 to 2017, which is decomposed into two distinct sub-periods after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), namely the immediate post-GFC (2009–2011) period and the normal (2012–2017) period, in order to identify the behavior of market risk for Vietnam’s major industries. For the stock market in Vietnam, the website used in this paper provided complete and detailed data for each stock, as classified by industry. Two widely used approaches to measure and analyze risk are used in the empirical analysis, namely Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). The empirical findings indicate that Energy and Pharmaceuticals are the least risky industries, whereas oil and gas and securities have the greatest risk. In general, there is strong empirical evidence that the four key industries display relatively low risk. For public policy, the Vietnam Government’s proactive emphasis on the targeted industries, including energy, to achieve sustainable economic growth and national economic development, seems to be working effectively. This paper presents striking empirical evidence that Vietnam’s industries have substantially improved their economic performance over the full sample, moving from relatively higher levels of market risk in the immediate post-GFC period to a lower risk environment in a normal period several years after the end of the calamitous GFC. © 2019 by the authors.

We fitted around 72 MSGARCH models with different regimes (k=1,2,3) to the log-returns of each precious metal to test in-sample analysis of volatility. We compare 72 models for in-sample analysis by using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and choose the best models for all precious metals’ series. Further, one-day ahead Value-at-Risk forecasting was conducted by the best MSGARCH. Our finding suggests the existence of regime changes in the GARCH process in most cases analyzed. We also find that regime-switching GARCH models outperform single–regime GARCH specifications when predicting the Value-at-Risk.

This model is based solely on closing prices. It has been documented in the literature that the high and low prices of a given day can be used to obtain an efficient volatility estimation. We therefore suggest a model that incorporates high and low prices into the DCC framework. We conduct an empirical evaluation of this model on three datasets: currencies, stocks, and commodity exchange traded funds. Regardless of whether we consider in-sample fit, covariance forecasts or value-at-risk forecasts, our model outperforms not only the standard DCC model, but also an alternative range-based DCC model. © 2019 The Authors","A non-Gaussian multivariate regime switching dynamic correlation model for financial asset returns is proposed. It incorporates the multivariate generalized hyperbolic law for the conditional distribution of returns. All model parameters are estimated consistently using a new two-stage expectation–maximization algorithm that also allows for incorporation of shrinkage estimation via quasi-Bayesian priors. It is shown that use of Markov switching correlation dynamics not only leads to highly accurate risk forecasts, but also potentially reduces the regulatory capital requirements during periods of distress. In terms of portfolio performance, the new regime switching model delivers consistently higher Sharpe ratios and smaller losses than the equally weighted portfolio and all competing models. Finally, the regime forecasts are employed in a new dynamic risk control strategy that avoids most losses during the financial crisis and vastly improves risk-adjusted returns. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","We investigate the dynamics of the relationship between returns and extreme downside risk in different states of the market by combining the framework of Bali et al. [Is there an intertemporal relation between downside risk and expected returns? Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 2009, 44, 883–909] with a Markov switching mechanism. We show that the risk-return relationship identified by Bali et al. (2009) is highly significant in the low volatility state but disappears during periods of market turbulence. This is puzzling since it is during such periods that downside risk should be most prominent. We show that the absence of the risk-return relationship in the high volatility state is due to leverage and volatility feedback effects arising from increased persistence in volatility. To better filter out these effects, we propose a simple modification that yields a positive tail risk-return relationship in all states of market volatility. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","Value-at-risk (VaR) has been playing the role of a standard risk measure since its introduction. In practice, the delta-normal approach is usually adopted to approximate the VaR of portfolios with option positions. Its effectiveness, however, substantially diminishes when the portfolios concerned involve a high dimension of derivative positions with nonlinear payoffs; lack of closed form pricing solution for these potentially highly correlated, American-style derivatives further complicate the problem. This paper proposes a generic simulation-based algorithm for VaR estimation that can be easily applied to any existing procedures. Our proposal leverages cross-sectional information and applies variable selection techniques to simplify the existing simulation framework. Asymptotic properties of the new approach demonstrate faster convergence due to the additional model selection component introduced. We have also performed sets of numerical results that verify the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with some existing strategies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","Risk capital allocations are of central importance in performance measurement. A popular solution concept in the academic literature is the Euler rule. This paper studies the volatility of the Euler rule for capital allocation in static and dynamic empirical applications with a simulated history. The Euler rule is not continuous with respect to small changes in the underlying risk capital allocation problem. We show that, when combined with value-at-risk, the Euler rule is very sensitive to empirical measurement error. The use of a known distribution with estimated parameters helps to reduce this error. The Euler rule with an expected shortfall risk measure is less volatile, but it is still more volatile than the proportional rule. © 2019 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","We propose a new backtesting framework for expected shortfall (ES) that can be used by regulators. Instead of looking at estimated capital reserve and realized cashflow separately, one can bind them into a secured position, for which risk measurement is much easier. Using this simple concept combined with monotonicity of ES with respect to its target confidence level, we introduce a natural and efficient backtesting framework. Our test statistics is given by the biggest number of worst realizations for the secured position that adds up to a negative total. Surprisingly, this simple quantity can be used to construct an efficient backtesting framework for unconditional coverage of ES in a natural extension of the regulatory traffic-light approach for value-at-risk. While being easy to calculate, the test statistic is based on the underlying duality between coherent risk measures and scale-invariant performance measures. © 2019 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","In various fields of applications such as capital allocation, sensitivity analysis, and systemic risk evaluation, one often needs to compute or estimate the expectation of a random variable, given that another random variable is equal to its quantile at some prespecified probability level. A primary example of such an application is the Euler capital allocation formula for the quantile (often called the value-at-risk), which is of crucial importance in financial risk management. It is well known that classic nonparametric estimation for the above quantile allocation problem has a slower rate of convergence than the standard rate. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to the quantile allocation problem via adjusting the probability level in connection with an expected shortfall. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed nonparametric estimator of the new capital allocation is derived for dependent data under the setup of a mixing sequence. In order to assess the performance of the proposed nonparametric estimator, AR-GARCH models are proposed to fit each risk variable, and further, a bootstrap method based on residuals is employed to quantify the estimation uncertainty. A simulation study is conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed inference. Finally, the proposed methodology of quantile capital allocation is illustrated for a financial data set. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","A wide range of risk measures can be written as functions of conditional tail moments (CTMs) and value-at-risk (VaR), for instance the expected shortfall (ES). In this paper, we derive joint central limit theory for semi-parametric estimates of CTMs, including in particular ES, at arbitrarily small risk levels. We also derive confidence corridors for VaR at different levels far out in the tail, which allows for simultaneous inference. We work under a semi-parametric Pareto-type assumption on the distributional tail of the observations and only require an extremal-near epoch dependence assumption on the serial dependence. In simulations, our semi-parametric ES estimate is often shown to be more accurate in terms of mean absolute deviation than extant non- and semi-parametric estimates. An empirical application to the extreme swings in Volkswagen log-returns during the failed takeover attempt by Porsche illustrates the proposed methods. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Empirical analysis of the most liquid commodities covering main sectors, including energy, food, agriculture, and precious and industrial metals, reveal several important stylized facts. We document common patterns of the dependence between future quantile returns and ex post as well as ex ante volatilities. We further show that the conditional returns distribution is platykurtic. The approach can serve as a useful risk management tool for investors interested in commodity futures contracts. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","The risk reducing benefits of the sovereign bond-backed security (SBBS) proposal of Brunnermeier et al. (2016) have been assessed in terms of the likely losses that different kinds of holders would suffer under simulated default scenarios. However, the effects of mark-to-market losses that may occur when there is rising uncertainty about defaults, or when self-fulfilling destabilising dynamics are prevalent, have not yet been examined. We apply the “VAR-for-VaR” method of Manganelli et al. (2015) and the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) approach of Brownlees and Engle (2012, 2017) to estimated yields of SBBS to assess how ex ante exposures and marginal contributions to systemic risk are likely to play-out for different SBBS tranches under various securitisation structures. We compare these with exposures/MES of single sovereigns and a diversified portfolio of sovereigns. We find that the senior SBBS has extremely low ex ante tail risk and that, like the low-risk sovereigns, it acts as a hedge against extreme market-wide yield movements. The mezzanine SBBS has tail risk exposure similar to that of Italian and Spanish bonds. Yields on SBBS appear to be adequate compensation for their risks when compared with single sovereigns or a diversified portfolio. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","The paper shows how to combine (historical) statistical data and (current) market prices to form conservative trading strategies for options.

In particular, we investigate the explanatory power of the Fama and French (1993)model augmented by and substituted with these three risk factors for distressed and non-distressed firms. For this purpose, we construct nine portfolios composed of non-distressed firms and one portfolio consisting only of distressed firms. We find that for the portfolios of non-distressed firms, the financial distress factor is significantly priced only in the absence of the size and book-to-market factors. Not surprisingly, the financial distress is a systematic risk factor for the portfolio of distressed firms. Our findings also show that liquidity is priced for the portfolios of distressed and non-distressed firms. Furthermore, our empirical results show that only investors in the portfolios of non-distressed firms are rewarded for bearing Value-at-Risk (VaR)risk. Likewise, our findings indicate that the alternative model, constructed by substituting the Fama and French (1993)factors with the financial distress, liquidity and VaR risk factors, underperforms the Fama and French (1993)model, which, in turn, underperforms the considered augmented models. Our results provide insights both for international investors for new opportunities and for financial market supervisory authority. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","I examine if the market tail risk can be the conditioning information for consumption-based asset pricing model. While “cay”, Lettau and Ludvigson's (2001) conditioning variable, no longer works in the extended sample period, I find that Value at Risk (VaR) is the conditioning variable that enables consumption CAPM to explain substantial variation of cross-section of stock returns. Asset's riskiness is determined by the correlation with consumption growth conditional on the tail risk of the aggregate market. © 2019","This paper performs a general GARCH and GAS analysis for modelling and forecasting bitcoin returns and risk. Since Bitcoin trading exhibits excess volatility compared with other securities, it is important to model its risk and returns. We consider heavy-tailed GARCH models as well as GAS models based on the score function of the predictive conditional density of the bitcoin returns. We compare out-of-sample 1%-Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts under 45 different specifications using three backtesting procedures. We find that GAS models with heavy-tailed distributions provide the best out-of-sample forecast and goodness-of-fit properties to bitcoin returns and risk modelling. Normally-distributed GARCH models are always outperformed by heavy-tailed GARCH or GAS models. Besides, heavy-tailed GAS models provide the best conditional and unconditional coverage for 1%-VaR forecasts, illustrating the importance of modelling excess kurtosis for bitcoin returns. Hence, our findings have important implications for risk managers and investors for using bitcoin in optimal hedging or investment strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Value at Risk (VaR) and stressed value at Risk (SVaR) or expected shortfall are important risk measures widely used in the financial services industry for risk management and market risk capital computation. Fundamental to any (S)VaR model is the choice of the return type model for each risk factor. Because the resulting SVaR numbers are highly sensitive to the chosen return type model it is important to make a prudent choice on the return type modelling. We propose to estimate the return type model from historic data without making an a priori model assumption on the return model. We explain the fundamentals of return type modelling and how it impacts the magnitude of SVaR. We further show how to obtain a global return type model from a set of similar return type models by using geometric calculus. Numerical simulations and illustrations are provided.

Drawing on the multi-quantile CAViaR model for two markets, this study proposes a multi-quantile CAViaR model for three markets and a multi-quantile CAViaR model for joint shock. The two new models are used to measure the impact of the U.S. Dollar index and the Euro on the overnight risk for the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen, Hong Kong Dollar, and Chinese Renminbi. The results show that, first, a lag risk affects the overnight risk of the three exchange rates, of which the Renminbi exchange rate is subject to the largest risk. Second, the U.S. Dollar index and Euro exchange rate risks impact the overnight risk of the three exchange rates and this effect is highest for the overnight risk of the Yen's exchange rate. In addition, the impact of the U.S.Dollar index risk is greater than that of the Euro. Third, the Euro and U.S.Dollar index produce a joint shock on the overnight risk of the three exchange rates, and here, the Yen's exchange rate suffers the biggest shock. Finally, the multi-quantile CAViaR model for joint shock is more accurate than that for three markets, particularly when the Hong Kong Dollar exchange rate has a 5% VaR. These empirical results have meaningful implications for regulatory authorities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Backtesting provides the means of determining the accuracy of risk forecasts and the corresponding risk model. Given that the actual return generating process is unknown, the evaluation methods rely on various assumptions in order to quantify the models inefficiencies and proceed with the model evaluation. These method specific assumptions, in conjunction with the regulatory policies can introduce distortions in the evaluation process, which affect the reliability of the evaluation results. To investigate such effects from a practitioner's perspective, this paper reviews the major Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall forecast evaluation methods and evaluates their performance under a common simulation and financial application framework. Our findings suggest that focusing on specific individual hypothesis tests provides a more reliable alternative than the corresponding conditional coverage ones.

The first is a non-parametric measure that captures the tendency of a stock to crash at the same time as the market, while the second is based on the sensitivity of stock returns to innovations in market crash risk.

Using the new measures, we examine the relevance for investors of the tail risk premium over different horizons. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Value-at-Risk (VaR) bounds for aggregated risks have been derived in the literature in settings where, besides the marginal distributions of the individual risk factors, one-sided bounds for the joint distribution or the copula of the risks are available. In applications, it turns out that these improved standard bounds on VaR tend to be too wide to be relevant for practical applications, especially when the number of risk factors is large or when the dependence restriction is not strong enough. In this paper, we develop a method to compute VaR bounds when besides the marginal distributions of the risk factors, two-sided dependence information in form of an upper and a lower bound on the copula of the risk factors is available. The method is based on a relaxation of the exact dual bounds that we derive by means of the Monge–Kantorovich transportation duality. In several applications, we illustrate that two-sided dependence information typically leads to strongly improved bounds on the VaR of aggregations. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","The realized-GARCH framework is extended to incorporate the two-sided Weibull distribution, for the purpose of volatility and tail risk forecasting in a financial time series. Further, the realized range, as a competitor for realized variance or daily returns, is employed as the realized measure in the realized-GARCH framework. Sub-sampling and scaling methods are applied to both the realized range and realized variance, to help deal with inherent micro-structure noise and inefficiency. A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is adapted and employed for estimation and forecasting, while various MCMC efficiency and convergence measures are employed to assess the validity of the method. In addition, the properties of the MCMC estimator are assessed and compared with maximum likelihood, via a simulation study. Compared to a range of well-known parametric GARCH and realized-GARCH models, tail risk forecasting results across seven market indices, as well as two individual assets, clearly favour the proposed realized-GARCH model incorporating the two-sided Weibull distribution; especially those employing the sub-sampled realized variance and sub-sampled realized range. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","The primary objective of this work is to analyze model based Value-at-Risk associated with mortality risk arising from issued term life assurance contracts and to compare the results with the capital requirements for mortality risk as determined using Solvency II Standard Formula. In particular, two approaches to calculate Value-at-Risk are analyzed: one-year VaR and run-off VaR. The calculations of Value-at-Risk are performed using stochastic mortality rates which are calibrated using the Lee-Carter model fitted using mortality data of selected European countries. Results indicate that, depending on the approach taken to calculate Value-at-Risk, the key factors driving its relative size are: sensitivity of technical provisions to the latest mortality experience, volatility of mortality rates in a country, policy term and benefit formula. Overall, we found that Solvency II Standard Formula on average delivers an adequate capital requirement, however, we also highlight particular situations where it could understate or overstate portfolio specific model based Value-at-Risk for mortality risk. © 2019 by the authors.

We propose an efficient numerical approach that allows us to compute risk measures for the CVA process by assessing the distribution of the CVA at a given horizon. This approach relies on a recursive formulation of the CVA, yielding the adjustment as a function of both the time to maturity and the value of the risk factors. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the impact of various parameters and assumptions on the CVA distribution. More specifically, we investigate the impact of the constant exposure approximation and show that this assumption significantly affects the tail of the distribution of CVA movements. We also find that distortions between physical and risk-neutral probability measures have practically no impact on the dispersion of the CVA distribution. Finally, we analyze the effect of wrong-way risk and of early exercise opportunities on the evaluation of risk measures. © 2019 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","We explore the Monte Carlo steps required to reduce the sampling error of the estimated 99.9% quantile within an acceptable threshold. Our research is of primary interest to practitioners working in the area of operational risk measurement, where the annual loss distribution cannot be analytically determined in advance. Usually, the frequency and the severity distributions should be adequately combined and elaborated with Monte Carlo methods, in order to estimate the loss distributions and risk measures. Naturally, financial analysts and regulators are interested in mitigating sampling errors, as prescribed in EU Regulation 2018/959. In particular, the sampling error of the 99.9% quantile is of paramount importance, along the lines of EU Regulation 575/2013. The Monte Carlo error for the operational risk measure is here assessed on the basis of the binomial distribution. Our approach is then applied to realistic simulated data, yielding a comparable precision of the estimate with a much lower computational effort, when compared to bootstrap, Monte Carlo repetition, and two other methods based on numerical optimization. © 2019 by the author.

In order to measure the crude oil price risk (VaR) and explain the dynamic relationship between investment income and risk in the oil market more clearly, this paper uses a variety of fractional GARCH models to describe typical volatility characteristics like long memory, volatility clustering, asymmetry and thick tail. The autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity in the mean model (ARCH-M) and peaks-over-threshold model of extreme value theory (EVT-POT) are taken into account to develop a hybrid time-varying long memory GARCH-M-EVT model for calculation of static and dynamic VaR. Empirical results show that the WTI crude oil has a significantly long memory feature. All the fractional integration GARCH models can describe the long memory appropriately and the FIAPARCH model is the best in regression and out of sample one-step-ahead VaR forecasting. Back-testing results show that the FIAPARCH-M-EVT model is superior to other GARCH-type models which only consider oil price fluctuation characteristics partially and traditional methods including Variance-Covariance and Monte Carlo in price risk measurement. Our conclusions confirm that considering long memory, asymmetry and fat tails in the behavior of energy commodity return combined with effectively dynamic time-varying risk reflection such as the ARCH-M model and reliable tail extreme filter processes such as EVT can improve the accuracy of crude oil price risk measurement, provide an effective tool for analyzing the extreme risk of the tail of the oil market and facilitate the risk management for oil market investors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","We test the presence of regime changes in the GARCH volatility dynamics of Bitcoin log–returns using Markov–switching GARCH (MSGARCH) models.

A dynamic Value-at-Risk constraint is imposed to manage the wealth process. By using Value at Risk as the risk measure during the investment horizon, the decision maker can dynamically monitor the exposed risk and quantify the maximum expected loss over a finite horizon period at a given confidence level. In addition, the decision maker has to filter the key economic factors to make decisions. Considering the cost of filtering the factors, the decision maker aims to maximize the utility of consumption in a finite horizon. By using the Kalman filter, a partially observed system is converted to a completely observed one. However, due to the cost of information processing, the decision maker fails to process the information in an arbitrarily rational manner and can only make decisions on the basis of the limited observed signals. A genetic algorithm was developed to find the optimal investment, consumption strategies, and observation strength. Numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.

We contribute to the current debate by testing for the existence of the leverage effect when considering daily spot returns in the WTI and Brent crude oil markets and by studying the direct impact of the leverage effect on measures of risk such as VaR and CVaR. More specifically, we model spot crude oil returns using Stochastic Volatility (SV) models with various distributions of the errors. We find that the introduction of the leverage effect in the traditional SV model with Normally distributed errors is capable of adequately estimating risk for speculative oil suppliers in both the WTI and Brent markets. Our results also show that financial regulators' model choice, both on the supply and on the demand side, would not be affected by the introduction of leverage. Focusing instead on firm's internal risk management, our results show that the introduction of leverage would be useful for firms who are on the demand side for oil, who use VaR for risk management and who are particularly worried about the magnitude of the losses exceeding VaR while wanting to minimize the opportunity cost of capital. Using the same logic, firms who are on the supply side would be better off not considering the leverage effect. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","This paper focuses on the forecasting of market risk measures for the Russian RTS index future, and examines whether augmenting a large class of volatility models with implied volatility and Google Trends data improves the quality of the estimated risk measures. We considered a time sample of daily data from 2006 till 2019, which includes several episodes of large-scale turbulence in the Russian future market. We found that the predictive power of several models did not increase if these two variables were added, but actually decreased. The worst results were obtained when these two variables were added jointly and during periods of high volatility, when parameters estimates became very unstable. Moreover, several models augmented with these variables did not reach numerical convergence. Our empirical evidence shows that, in the case of Russian future markets, TGARCH models with implied volatility and Student’s t errors are better choices if robust market risk measures are of concern. © 2019 Sinergia Press.

In this paper, we allow the dependence parameters of the pair-copulas in a D-vine decomposition to be potentially time-varying, following a restricted ARMA(1, m) process, in order to obtain a very flexible dependence model for applications to multivariate financial return data. We investigate the dependence among the broad stock market indexes from Germany (DAX), France (CAC 40), Britain (FTSE 100), the United States (S&amp;P 500) and Brazil (IBOVESPA) both in a crisis and in a non-crisis period. We find evidence of stronger dependence among the indexes in bear markets. Surprisingly, though, the dynamic D-vine copula indicates the occurrence of a sharp decrease in dependence between the indexes FTSE and CAC in the beginning of 2011, and also between CAC and DAX during mid-2011 and in the beginning of 2008, suggesting the absence of contagion in these cases. We evaluate the dynamic D-vine copula with respect to Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting accuracy in crisis periods. The dynamic D-vine outperforms the static D-vine in terms of predictive accuracy for our real data sets. We also investigate the dynamic D-vine copula in a simulation study and the overall results of the Monte Carlo experiments are quite favorable to the dynamic D-vine copula in comparison with a static D-vine copula. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Determining risk contributions of unit exposures to portfolio-wide economic capital is an important task in financial risk management. Computing risk contributions involves difficulties caused by rare-event simulations. In this study, we address the problem of estimating risk contributions when the total risk is measured by value-at-risk (VaR). Our proposed estimator of VaR contributions is based on the Metropolis-Hasting (MH) algorithm, which is one of the most prevalent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Unlike existing estimators, our MH-based estimator consists of samples from the conditional loss distribution given a rare event of interest. This feature enhances sample efficiency compared with the crude Monte Carlo method. Moreover, our method has consistency and asymptotic normality, and is widely applicable to various risk models having a joint loss density. Our numerical experiments based on simulation and real-world data demonstrate that in various risk models, even those having high-dimensional (≈500) inhomogeneous margins, our MH estimator has smaller bias and mean squared error when compared with existing estimators. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","In this paper, we present a novel approach for forecasting Value-at-Risk (VaR) by combining a Bayesian GARCH(1,1) model with Student's-t distribution for the underlying volatility models, vine copula functions to model dependence, and the peaks-over-threshold (POT) method of extreme value theory (EVT) to model the tail behaviour of asset returns. We further propose a new approach for threshold selection in extreme value analysis, which we call a hybrid method. The empirical results and back-testing analysis show that the model captures VaR quite well through periods of calmness and crisis; therefore, it is suitable for use as a measure of risk. Our results also suggest that with a correct implementation of the VaR model, Basel III is not needed. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","We examine the effectiveness of Foster-Hart optimization for currency portfolios. Compared to stock trading, short selling is quite common in currency trading. Combining long and short positions leads to maintaining positive expected portfolio returns. Foster-Hart optimization is more applicable to currency portfolios than to stock portfolios because the Foster-Hart risk measure is not defined for the gamble whose expected returns are negative. Our sample portfolio consists of ten European currencies. For time series analysis, we employ a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model with multivariate normal tempered stable (MNTS) distributed residuals in order to capture fat-tailedness, skewness, and asymmetric interdependence of exchange rate dynamics. Statistical tests indicate that the model is recommendable among the candidate models.

Yet, its serious drawback of underestimating an asset's market risk has been noticed in numerous applications, and many alternative risk measures have been proposed in the literature. Among all existing alternative risk measures, it is hard to find one that a financial institution whose portfolio has multiple settlements before the end of holding period uses to internally perform risk assessment. We propose a new risk measure termed mark to market value at risk (MMVaR) for settlement being taken daily during the holding period. MMVaR is a natural alternative risk measure to VaR as it is a direct generalization of VaR. It not only maintains easily interpretable feature held by VaR, but also better computes an asset's market risk in a financial institution having daily account settlements. We show that MMVaR is superior to VaR using simulation examples and real data. In real data analysis, we find that risks calculated using MMVaR are about 20% higher than risks calculated using classical VaR, which provides an evidence proof of Basel III's new capital adequacy ratio requirement, and hence it can become an implementable daily risk measure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","We introduce new Markov-switching (MS) dynamic conditional score (DCS) exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) models, to be used by practitioners for forecasting value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) in systematic risk analysis. We use daily log-return data from the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 (S&amp;P 500) index for the period 1950–2016. The analysis of the S&amp;P 500 is useful, for example, for investors of (i) well-diversified US equity portfolios; (ii) S&amp;P 500 futures and options traded at Chicago Mercantile Exchange Globex; (iii) exchange traded funds (ETFs) related to the S&amp;P 500. The new MS DCS-EGARCH models are alternatives to of the recent MS Beta-t-EGARCH model that uses the symmetric Student’s t distribution for the error term. For the new models, we use more flexible asymmetric probability distributions for the error term: Skew-Gen-t (skewed generalized t), EGB2 (exponential generalized beta of the second kind) and NIG (normal-inverse Gaussian) distributions. For all MS DCS-EGARCH models, we identify high- and low-volatility periods for the S&amp;P 500. We find that the statistical performance of the new MS DCS-EGARCH models is superior to that of the MS Beta-t-EGARCH model.

Motivated by recent results showing that the choice of VaR estimator does not crucially influence decision-making in certain practical applications (e.g. in investment rankings), this study analyses the important question of how asset allocation decisions are affected when alternative VaR estimation methodologies are used. Focusing on the most popular, successful and conceptually different conditional VaR estimation techniques (i.e. historical simulation, peak over threshold method and quantile regression) and the flexible portfolio model of Campbell et al. [J. Banking Finance. 2001, 25(9), 1789–1804], we show in an empirical example and in a simulation study that these methods tend to deliver similar asset weights. In other words, optimal portfolio allocations appear to be not very sensitive to the choice of VaR estimator. This finding, which is robust in a variety of distributional environments and pre-whitening settings, supports the notion that, depending on the specific application, simple standard methods (i.e. historical simulation) used by many commercial banks do not necessarily have to be replaced by more complex approaches (based on, e.g. extreme value theory). © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This paper develops a new multiple time scale-based empirical framework for market risk estimates and forecasts. Ultra-high frequency data are used in the empirical analysis to estimate the parameters of empirical scaling laws which gives a better understanding of the dynamic nature of the market. A comparison of the new approach with the popular Value-at-Risk and expected tail loss measures with respect to their risk forecasts during the crisis period in 2008 is presented. The empirical results show the outperformance of the new scaling law method which turns out to be more accurate and flexible due to the scale invariance.

We apply several widely used methods for calculating VaR, including both parametric and nonparametric methods. We consider different confidence levels for the VaR as well as different sample sizes. To test our models' validity, we use both unconditional and conditional coverage backtests. In addition, we use a ranking method (which entails a backtesting approach based on the regulatory loss function) to appropriately compare the VaR calculation methods. Obtained from data for three different indexes (namely, Iranian, Turkish and Russian), our backtesting results indicate that parametric models from the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity family, with asymmetric effects and fat tails (associated with their useof a t distribution), display the best performance. That is, the best-performing models under emerging market conditions are those that satisfy three important criteria simultaneously. First, they account for the time-varying variance. Second, they capture the asymmetric nature of shocks. Third, they are able to deal with fat tails in the distribution. These can also be regarded as the main features of emerging markets. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","This paper aims to reflect the current state of the discussion on the validation of market risk forecasts by means of backtesting. Due to the upcoming Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), the importance of expected shortfall (ES) as a risk measure will be significantly strengthened, which, in turn, should influence the discussion on appropriate approaches for its proper validation. While procedures based on forecast distribution and backtesting for value-at-risk have already been established and discussed intensively, the development of a standard for backtesting ES is still in full swing. In addition to a classification in this context, our paper offers a practical application for backtesting via an example portfolio with three comparative models and shows how to integrate the different backtesting methods in a holistic framework. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","In recent times, investing in volatile security increases the risk of losses and reduces gains. Many traders who depend on these risks indulge in multiple volatility procedures to inform their trading strategies. We explore two models to measure the tails behaviour and the period the stock will gain or fall within a five-month trading period. We obtained data from the Ghana stock exchange and applied generalized extreme value distribution validated by backtesting and an artificial neural network for forecasting. The network training produces and manages more than 90% accuracy respectively for gains and falls for given input-output pairs. Based on this, estimates of extreme value distribution proves that it is formidable. There is a significant development in market prediction in assessing the results of actual and forecast performance. The study reveals that once every five months, at a 5% confidence level, the market is expected to gain and fall 2.12% and 2.23%, respectively. The Ghana stock exchange market showed a maximum monthly stock gain above or below 2.12% in the fourth and fifth months, whiles maximum monthly stock fell above or below 2.23% in the third and fourth months. The study reveals that once every five months’ trading period, the stock market will gain and fall by almost an equal percentage, with a significant increase in value-at-risk and expected shortfall at the left tail as the quantiles increases compared to the right tail. © 2018 by the authors.

The seven models are constructed by four types of bivariate variance-covariance specifications and two approaches of parameters estimates. The four types of bivariate variance-covariance specifications are the constant conditional correlation (CCC), asymmetric and symmetric dynamic conditional correlation (ADCC and DCC), and the BEKK, whereas the two types of approach include the standard and non-standard approaches. Empirical results show that, regarding the accuracy tests, the VaR forecast performance of stock portfolios varies with the variance-covariance specifications and the approaches of parameters estimate, whereas it does not vary with the weight combinations of portfolios. Conversely, the VaR forecast performance of currency-stock portfolios is almost the same for all models and still does not vary with the weight combinations of portfolios. Regarding the efficiency test via market risk capital, the NS-BEKK model is the most suitable model to be used in the stock and currency-stock portfolios for bank risk managers irrespective of the weight combination of portfolios. © 2018 by the authors.

Specifically, an autoregressive conditional Fréchet (AcF) model is proposed in which the maxima are modeled by a Fréchet distribution with time-varying scale parameter (volatility) and shape parameter (tail index) conditioned on past information. The AcF provides a direct and accurate modeling of the time-varying behavior of maxima and furthermore offers a new angle to study the tail risk dynamics in financial markets. Probabilistic properties of AcF are studied, and a maximum likelihood estimator is used for model estimation, with its statistical properties investigated. Simulations show the flexibility of AcF and confirm the reliability of its estimators. Two real data examples on cross-sectional stock returns and high-frequency foreign exchange returns are used to demonstrate the AcF modeling approach, where significant improvement over the static GEV has been observed for market tail risk monitoring and conditional VaR estimation. Empirical result of AcF is consistent with the findings of the dynamic peak-over-threshold (POT) literature that the tail index of financial markets varies through time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","This paper proposes a multivariate copula-based volatility model for estimating Value-at-Risk (VaR) in the banking sector of selected European countries by combining dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) multivariate GARCH (M-GARCH) volatility model and copula functions. Non-normality in multivariate models is associated with the joint probability of the univariate models' marginal probabilities –the joint probability of large market movements, referred to as tail dependence. In this paper, we use copula functions to model the tail dependence of large market movements and test the validity of our results by performing back-testing techniques. The results show that the copula-based approach provides better estimates than the common methods currently used and captures VaR reasonably well based on the differences in the numbers of exceptions produced during different observation periods at the same confidence level. © 2018 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy","We investigate a mean-risk model for portfolio optimization where the risk quantifier is selected as a semi-deviation or as a standard deviation of the portfolio return. We analyse the existence of solutions to the problem under general assumptions. When the short positions are not constrained, we establish a lower bound on the cost of risk associated with optimizing the mean–standard deviation model and show that optimal solutions do not exist for any positive price of risk which is smaller than that bound. If the investment allocations are constrained, then we obtain a lower bound on the price of risk in terms of the shadow prices of said constraints and the data of the problem. A Value-at-Risk constraint in the model implies an upper bound on the price of risk for all feasible portfolios. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which using this upper bound as the cost of risk parameter in the model provides a non-dominated optimal portfolio with respect to the second-order stochastic dominance. Additionally, we study the relationship between minimizing the mean–standard deviation objective and maximizing the coefficient of variation and show that both problems are equivalent when the upper bound is used as the cost of risk. Additional relations between the Value-at-Risk constraint and the coefficient of variation are discussed as well. We illustrate the results numerically. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","Fluctuations in the crude oil price allied to risk have increased significantly over the last decade frequently varying at different risk levels. Although existing models partially predict such variations, so far, they have been unable to predict oil prices accurately in this highly volatile market. The development of an effective, predictive model has therefore become a prime objective of research in this field. Our approach, albeit based in part on previous research, develops an original methodology, in that we have created a risk forecasting model with the ability to predict oil price fluctuations caused by changes in both fundamental and transient risk factors. We achieve this by disintegrating the multi-scale risk-structure of the crude oil market using Variational Mode Decomposition. Normal and transient risk factors are then extracted from the crude oil price using Variational Mode Decomposition and modelled separately using the Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) model. Both risk factors are integrated and ensembled to produce the risk estimates. We then apply our proposed risk forecasting model to predicting future downside risk level in three major crude oil markets, namely the West Taxes Intermediate (WTI), the Brent Market, and the OPEC market. The results demonstrate that our model has the ability to capture downside risk estimates with significantly improved precision, thus reducing estimation errors and increasing forecasting reliability. © 2018","This article studies the optimal portfolio selection of expected utility-maximizing investors who must also manage their market-risk exposures. The risk is measured by a so-called weighted value-at-risk (WVaR) risk measure, which is a generalization of both value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). The feasibility, well-posedness, and existence of the optimal solution are examined. We obtain the optimal solution (when it exists) and show how risk measures change asset allocation patterns. In particular, we characterize three classes of risk measures: the first class will lead to models that do not admit an optimal solution, the second class can give rise to endogenous portfolio insurance, and the third class, which includes VaR and ES, two popular regulatory risk measures, will allow economic agents to engage in “regulatory capital arbitrage,” incurring larger losses when losses occur. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Penalized quantile regressions are proposed for the combination of Value-at-Risk forecasts. The primary reason for regularization of the quantile regression estimator with the elastic net, lasso and ridge penalties is multicollinearity among the standalone forecasts, which results in poor forecast performance of the non-regularized estimator due to unstable combination weights. This new approach is applied to combining the Value-at-Risk forecasts of a wide range of frequently used risk models for stocks comprising the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. Within a thorough comparison analysis, the penalized quantile regressions perform better in terms of backtesting and tick losses than the standalone models and several competing forecast combination approaches. This is particularly evident during the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. © 2017 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics","A functional ARMA-GARCH model for predicting the value-at-risk of the EURUSD exchange rate is introduced. The model implements the yield curve differentials between EUR and the US as exogenous factors. Functional principal component analysis allows us to use the information of basically the whole yield curve in a parsimonious way for exchange rate risk prediction. The data analyzed in our empirical study consist of the EURUSD exchange rate and the EUR-and US-yield curves from 15 August 2005–30 September 2016. As a benchmark, we take an ARMA-GARCH and an ARMAX-GARCHX with the 2y-yield difference as the exogenous variable and compare the forecasting performance via likelihood ratio tests. However, while our model performs better in one situation, it does not seem to improve the performance in other setups compared to its competitors. © 2018 by the authors.

Such calculations can be improved by granularity adjustment (GA) techniques if there remains a significant amount of undiversified idiosyncratic risk. We explain why it is so difficult to obtain analytic approximations of risk measures through granularity adjustment, when the underlying portfolio losses depend on several systematic factors. We propose several flexible families of models to manage the market and/or the counterparty risk of portfolios of financial assets. Explicit closed-form formulas based on GA techniques are provided, to approximate value-at-risks. We take into account random exposures, random recoveries and default risk simultaneously. Such models can be applied to portfolios of bonds, loans, stocks or even derivatives. We prove the accuracy of such analytic approximations through simulations, when the vectors of systematic factors are Gaussian or elliptical, more generally. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","In this paper we investigate different VaR forecasts for daily energy commodities returns using GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) and the Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk (CAViaR) models. We further develop a Dynamic Quantile Regression (DQR) one where the parameters evolve over time following a first order stochastic process. The models considered are selected employing the Model Confidence Set procedure of Hansen et al. (2011) which provides a superior set of models by testing the null hypothesis of Equal Predictive Ability. Successively information coming from each model is pooled together using a weighted average approach. The empirical analysis is conducted on seven energy commodities. The results show that the quantile approach i.e. the CAViaR and the DQR outperform all the others for all the series considered and that, generally, VaR aggregation yields better results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Any risk-return tradeoff analysis in aggregate equity markets relies on appropriate measures of risk, in most studies based on (co-)variance relations. Consequently, in integrated global markets, country-specific expected return is priced with a world price of covariance risk. This study relates domestic excess stock returns to the world downside risk. Evidence shows that downside tail risk (as a multiplier of volatility) has long memory cointegration properties; hence, the underlying risk aversion behavior in an integrated market is associated with the conditional quantile ratio, the correlation of stock returns, and the cointegrating coefficient of downside risk. Our empirical results based on G7 countries indicate that investors are averse to downside risk, which via Cornish–Fisher expansions is related to higher moment risk and interpretable in a utility-based decision framework. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","This paper offers a new approach to modeling the distribution of a portfolio composed of either asset returns or insurance losses. To capture the leptokurtosis, which is inherent in most financial series, data are modeled by using Gram-Charlier (GC) expansions. Since we are interested in operating with several series simultaneously, the distribution of the sum of GC random variables is derived. This latter turns out to be a tail-sensitive density, suitable for modeling the distribution of a portfolio return-losses and, accordingly, can be conveniently adopted for computing risk measures such as the value at risk and the expected shortfall as well as some performance measures based on its partial moments. The closed form expressions of these risk measures are derived for cases when the density of a portfolio is the sum of GC expansions, either with the same or different kurtosis. An empirical application of this approach to a portfolio of financial asset indexes provides evidence of the comparative effectiveness of this technique in computing risk measures, both in and out of the sample period. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Numerical standard error (NSE) is an estimate of the standard deviation of a simulation result if the simulation experiment were to be repeated many times. We review standard methods for computing NSE and perform a Monte Carlo experiments to compare their performance in the case of high/extreme autocorrelation. In particular, we propose an application to risk management where we assess the precision of the value-at-risk measure when the underlying risk model is estimated by simulation-based methods. Overall, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation estimators with prewhitening perform best in the presence of large/extreme autocorrelation. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.","We propose a new methodology based on copula functions to estimate CoVaR, the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of the financial system conditional on an institution being under financial distress. Our Copula CoVaR approach provides simple, closed-form expressions for various definitions of CoVaR for a broad range of copula families and allows the CoVaR of an institution to have time-varying exposure to its VaR. We extend this approach to estimate other ‘co-risk’ measures such as Conditional Expected Shortfall (CoES). We focus on a portfolio of large European banks and examine the existence of common market factors triggering systemic risk episodes. Further, we analyse the extent to which bank-specific characteristics such as size, leverage, and equity beta are associated with institutions' contribution to systemic risk and highlight the importance of liquidity risk at the outset of the financial crisis in summer 2007. Finally, we investigate the link between macroeconomy and systemic risk and find that changes in major macroeconomic variables can contribute significantly to systemic risk. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This article reviews two leading measures of financial risk and an emerging alternative. Embraced by the Basel accords, value-at-risk and expected shortfall are the leading measures of financial risk. Expectiles offset the weaknesses of value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall. Indeed, expectiles are the only elicitable law-invariant coherent risk measures. After reviewing practical concerns involving backtesting and robustness, this article more closely examines regulatory applications of expectiles. Expectiles are most readily evaluated as a special class of quantiles. For ease of regulatory implementation, expectiles can be defined exclusively in terms of VaR, expected shortfall, and the thresholds at which those competing risk measures are enforced. Moreover, expectiles are in harmony with gain/loss ratios in financial risk management. Expectiles may address some of the flaws in VaR and expected shortfall—subject to the reservation that no risk measure can achieve exactitude in regulation. © 2018 by the author.

To illustrate the results, we use four financial share portfolios selected to exemplify this purpose. For each share, we calculate filtered log returns using autoregressive moving average–generalized autoregressive conditional hetero-scedasticity models and study their dependence. We analyze how selecting pairs of assets to define vines prior to pair–copula decomposition affects the estimated VaR and CVaR. Further, using bootstrap confidence intervals, we compare the results of different risk measures obtained by employing alternative measures of dependence to select the order in which the drawable vine (D-vine) is defined in different portfolios. Moreover, we carry out a simulation study to analyze the finite sample properties of the different criteria for selecting the pair–copula decomposition associated with the D-vine. We find some differences between the results obtained for VaR and CVaR. © Infopro Digital Limited 2018.

To fill this gap, we apply different estimation window strategies to a set of simple parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric industry-standard risk models. Analyzing daily return data on constituents of the German Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX), we evaluate forecasts by backtesting the unconditional coverage and independent and identically distributed properties of VaR violations, the ES forecasting accuracy and the conditional predictive ability. We thereby demonstrate that the selection of the estimation window strategy leads to significant performance differences. The results indicate that forecast combinations are the preferable estimation window strategy. © Infopro Digital Limited 2018.

This paper develops an economic state-dependent (SD) approach to evaluate carbon market Value-at-Risk (VaR) that incorporates information from macroeconomic fundamentals into carbon return VaR modeling and forecasting. This method implements an economic SD sampling scheme that utilizes historical carbon return observations from the relevant economic states to predict future carbon market VaR. Applying this SD method to the European Union (EU) carbon market, we confirm that the EU fundamental economy has two distinct states that correspond to “expansion” and “recession” periods and that the carbon returns have different distributions in the two states. We find that the SD method outperforms the traditional non-SD methods in out-of-sample VaR forecasts, and this is particularly evident when the carbon market experiences large-scale economy-driven structural breaks. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","The estimation of risk measures recently gained a lot of attention, partly because of the backtesting issues of expected shortfall related to elicitability. In this work we shed a new and fundamental light on optimal estimation procedures of risk measures in terms of bias. We show that once the parameters of a model need to be estimated, one has to take additional care when estimating risks. The typical plug-in approach, for example, introduces a bias which leads to a systematic underestimation of risk. In this regard, we introduce a novel notion of unbiasedness to the estimation of risk which is motivated by economic principles. In general, the proposed concept does not coincide with the well-known statistical notion of unbiasedness. We show that an appropriate bias correction is available for many well-known estimators. In particular, we consider value-at-risk and expected shortfall (tail value-at-risk). In the special case of normal distributions, closed-formed solutions for unbiased estimators can be obtained. We present a number of motivating examples which show the outperformance of unbiased estimators in many circumstances. The unbiasedness has a direct impact on backtesting and therefore adds a further viewpoint to established statistical properties. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","This paper focuses on risk over long time horizons and within extreme percentiles, which have attracted considerable recent interest in numerous subfields of finance. Value at risk (VaR) aggregates several components of asset risk into a single quantitative measurement and is commonly used in tail risk management. Due to realistic data limits, many practitioners might use the square-root-of-time rule (SRTR) to compute long-term VaR. However, serial dependence and heavy-tailedness can bias the SRTR. This paper addresses two deficiencies of the study by Wang et al. (2011), who propose the modified-SRTR (MSRTR) to partially correct the serial dependence and use subsampling estimation as the benchmark to verify the performance of MSRTR. First, we investigate the validity of the subsampling approach through numerical simulations. Second, to reduce the heavy-tailedness bias, we propose a new MSRTR approach (MSRTR∗) in light of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). In the empirical study, 28 country-level exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from 2010 to 2015 are considered to estimate the 30-day VaR. After modifying both serial dependence and heavy-tailedness, our approach reduces the bias from 26.46% to 5.97%, on average, compared to the SRTR. We also provide a backtesting analysis to verify the robustness of the MSRTR∗. This new approach should be considered when estimating long-term VaR using short-term VaR. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are designed to produce efficient estimates of simulated values but the error statistics of these estimates are difficult to compute. Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods have been developed to address this shortcoming. In this paper we compare quasi-Monte Carlo and randomized quasi-Monte Carlo techniques for simulating time series. We use randomized quasi-Monte Carlo to compute value-at-risk and expected shortfall measures for a stock portfolio whose returns follow a highly nonlinear Markov switching stochastic volatility model which does not admit analytical solutions for the returns distribution. Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are more accurate but do not allow the computation of reliable confidence intervals about risk measures. We find that randomized quasi-Monte Carlo methods maintain many of the advantages of quasi-Monte Carlo while also providing the ability to produce reliable confidence intervals of the simulated risk measures. However, the advantages in speed of convergence of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo diminish as the forecast horizon increases. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","This paper (this work was achieved through the Laboratory of Excellence on Financial Regulation (Labex ReFi) supported by PRES heSam under the reference ANR-10-LABEX-0095) analyses how risks are measured in financial institutions, for instance Market, Credit, Operational, among others with respect to the choice of risk measures, the choice of distributions used to model them and the level of confidence selected. We discuss and illustrate the characteristics, the paradoxes and the issues observed, comparing the Value-at-Risk and the Expected Shortfall in practice. This paper is built as a differential diagnosis and aims at discussing the reliability of the risk measures and making some recommendations. (This paper has been written in a very particular period of time as most regulatory papers written in the past 20 years are currently being questioned by both practitioners and regulators themselves. Some disarray has been observed among risk managers as most models required by the regulation have not been consistent with their own objective of risk management. The enlightenment brought by this paper is based on an academic analysis of the issues engendered by some pieces of regulation and its purpose is not to create any sort of controversy.) © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","In this study, we compare the out-of-sample forecasting performance of several modern Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimators derived from extreme value theory (EVT). Specifically, in a multi-asset study covering 30 years of stock, bond, commodity and currency market data, we analyse the accuracy of the classic generalised Pareto peak over threshold approach and three recently proposed methods based on the Box–Cox transformation, L-moment estimation and the Johnson system of distributions. We find that, in their unconditional form, some of the estimators may be acceptable under current regulatory assessment rules but none of them can continuously pass more advanced tests of forecasting accuracy. In their conditional forms, forecasting power is significantly increased and the Box–Cox method proves to be the most promising estimator. However, it is also important to stress that the traditional historical simulation approach, which is currently the most frequently used VaR estimator in commercial banks, can not only keep up with the EVT-based methods but occasionally even outperforms them (depending on the setting: unconditional versus conditional). Thus, recent claims to generally replace this simple method by theoretically more advanced EVT-based methods may be premature. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","The Value at Risk (VaR) is a risk measure that is widely used by financial institutions in allocating risk. VaR forecast estimation involves the conditional evaluation of quantiles based on the currently available information. Recent advances in VaR evaluation incorporate conditional variance into the quantile estimation, yielding the Conditional Autoregressive VaR (CAViaR) models. However, the large number of alternative CAViaR models raises the issue of identifying the optimal quantile predictor. To resolve this uncertainty, we propose a Bayesian encompassing test that evaluates various CAViaR models predictions against a combined CAViaR model based on the encompassing principle. This test provides a basis for forecasting combined conditional VaR estimates when there are evidences against the encompassing principle. We illustrate this test using simulated and financial daily return data series. The results demonstrate that there are evidences for using combined conditional VaR estimates when forecasting quantile risk. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This paper presents the first methodological proposal of estimation of the ΛVaR. Our approach is dynamic and calibrated to market extreme scenarios, incorporating the need of regulators and financial institutions in more sensitive risk measures. We also propose a simple backtesting methodology by extending the VaR hypothesis-testing framework. Hence, we test our ΛVaR proposals under extreme downward scenarios of the financial crisis and different assumptions on the profit and loss distribution. The findings show that our ΛVaR estimations are able to capture the tail risk and react to market fluctuations significantly faster than the VaR and expected shortfall.

We argue that backtesting of the forecasting models used to derive ES can be based on a multinomial test of Value-at-Risk (VaR) exceptions at several levels. Using simulation experiments with heavy-tailed distributions and GARCH volatility models, we design a statistical procedure to show that at least four VaR levels are required to obtain tests for misspecified trading book models that are more powerful than single-level (or even two-level) binomial exception tests.

These filtered historical simulation (FHS)VaR models are nowwidely used in the industry and, as is usually the case withVaRmodels, they are validated through backtesting. However, while backtesting is a natural way of testing a percentile forecast, it is not specifically designed to capture other features of the model, such as its efficiency in adapting to new volatility conditions. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of backtesting as a tool to assess the performance of FHS models and, using a Monte Carlo simulation framework, we examine whether incorporating information about the size of the breaches (through the use of score functions, for example) can improve the efficiency of these tests. The results show that, even when incorporating the size of theVaR violations, tests based solely on the breaches generally fail as a tool to discriminate between different calibrations of the decay factor; they also tend to be biased. Among the alternative tests considered, the asymmetric piecewise linear score performs best overall, followed by the dynamicquantile test.We conclude by considering some empirical examples. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","Foster and Hart (2009) introduce an objective measure of the riskiness of an asset that implies a bound on how much of one's wealth is ‘safe’ to invest in the asset while (a.s.) guaranteeing no-bankruptcy. In this study, we translate the Foster–Hart measure from static and abstract gambles to dynamic and applied finance using nonparametric estimation of risk-neutral densities from S&amp;P 500 call and put option prices covering 2003–2013. The dynamics of the resulting ‘option-implied Foster–Hart bound’ are assessed in light of other well-known option-implied risk measures including value at risk, expected shortfall and risk-neutral volatility, as well as high moments of the densities and several industry measures. Rigorous variable selection reveals that the new measure is a significant predictor of (large) ahead-return downturns. Furthermore, it grasps more characteristics of the risk-neutral probability distributions in terms of moments than other measures and exhibits predictive consistency. The robustness of the risk-neutral density estimation is analyzed via Monte Carlo methods. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","The provision of initial margin (IM) for noncentrally cleared derivatives has gained prominence in financial markets as a way to mitigate counterparty credit risk. IM protects transacting parties from the potential increase in future exposure that could arise from the portfolio value change during the time that it takes to close out and replace the portfolio following a counterparty default. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision prescribes IM as the ten-day value-at-risk (VaR) of the portfolio at the 99th percentile confidence level. Current industry standard VaR approaches such as parametric or historical VaR methods necessitate an assumption that IM is posted in cash or cash-equivalent assets. Although many counterparty-credit-risk-related models exist in the academic literature, there has been little focus on achieving a theoretical basis for calculating margin with consideration of market risk of the collateral. In this paper, we explore the complication of calculating the IM amount required when collateral comprises risky assets in a parametric VaR framework. We show that the required IM amount can be calculated by solving a quadratic inequality. We also introduce a geometric structure to compare the IM amounts calculated using risky and nonrisky collateral. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","For a given time series of daily losses that display volatility clustering, the exact next-day and ten-day value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are unknown. The usual procedure is to approximate these values by replacing true parameter values with estimates in the formulas for VaR and ES. Parameter estimation errors for a GARCH(1,1) model for this time series lead to approximate VaR and ES that differ from the exact VaR and ES, respectively. Accurate estimation of the VaR and ES is very important for the proper management of financial risks. In this paper, we find linear regression models in which the response variable is the approximate VaR (ES) and the explanatory variable is the exact VaR (ES). We use these linear regression models to determine the properties of the approximate VaR (ES), conditional on the corresponding exact value. For a given value of the exact VaR (ES), the approximate VaR (ES) is close to being an unbiased estimator of the corresponding exact value, but it may differ from this exact value by more than 10% of the exact value with substantial probability. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","Based on risk-value models, we introduce a multiperiod approach to the valuation of streams of risky cashflows.

In order to obtain an answer to this question, we test the applicability and compare the performances of the HS500 and the autoregressive moving average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity-BootstrapHS500 (ARMA-GARCH-BootstrapHS500) models on the capital markets of Serbia, Croatia, Greece, Spain, Germany, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary. The results of our research show that the new model performed better than the HS model. Thus, we can conclude that incorporating the bootstrap approach into the HS approach contributes to improving the applicability of the HS approach. © 2017 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","In this study, we propose a non-linear random mapping model called GELM. The proposed model is based on a combination of the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and can be used to calculate Value-at-Risk (VaR). Alternatively, the GELM model is a non-parametric GARCH-type model. Compared with conventional models, such as the GARCH models, ELM, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the computational results confirm that the GELM model performs better in volatility forecasting and VaR calculation in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Thus, the GELM model can be an essential tool for risk management and stress testing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","This paper introduces a semiparametric framework for selecting either a Gaussian or a Student's t copula in a d-dimensional setting. We compare the two models using four different approaches: (i) four goodness-of-fit graphical plots, (ii) a bootstrapped correlation matrix generated in each scenario with the empirical correlation matrix used as a benchmark, (iii) Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) as risk measures, and (iv) co-Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) and Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) as co-risk measures. We illustrate this four-step procedure using a portfolio of daily returns of six international stock indices. The VaR results confirm that the t-based copula model is an attractive alternative to the Gaussian. The ES analysis is less conclusive, and indicates that risk managers should jointly use the risk measure as well as the copula model. The results highlight the importance of promoting stress testing rather than ES in the risk management industry, particularly in the aftermath of a financial crisis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Recent research in economy, especially in finance, is using the assumption that the returns distribution is normal for determining optimal allocation for different models in finance optimization like Markowitz model. However this assumption is not already exact because the problem of the asymmetric distribution has a big impact.

In this paper, we investigate the dynamic mean–VaR portfolio selection formulation in continuous time, while the majority of the current literature on mean–VaR portfolio selection mainly focuses on its static versions. Our contributions are twofold, in both building up a tractable formulation and deriving the corresponding optimal portfolio policy. By imposing a limit funding level on the terminal wealth, we conquer the ill-posedness exhibited in the original dynamic mean–VaR portfolio formulation. To overcome the difficulties arising from the VaR constraint and no bankruptcy constraint, we have combined the martingale approach with the quantile optimization technique in our solution framework to derive the optimal portfolio policy. In particular, we have characterized the condition for the existence of the Lagrange multiplier. When the opportunity set of the market setting is deterministic, the portfolio policy becomes analytical. Furthermore, the limit funding level not only enables us to solve the dynamic mean–VaR portfolio selection problem, but also offers a flexibility to tame the aggressiveness of the portfolio policy. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This article considers the most important information technology (IT) products in order to perform an event-study analysis of the out-of-sample predictability of IT stock returns. We define two subperiods, the estimation and forecast windows, for each IT product that are separated by the product release date. We investigate whether post-release-date returns can be predicted by using data on pre-release-date returns. We use static one-step-ahead density forecasting. We compare the forecast performance of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) plus generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) and quasi-ARMA (QARMA) plus Beta-t-EGARCH (exponential-GARCH). QARMA plus Beta-t-EGARCH belongs to the family of dynamic conditional score (DCS) models. We find that the in-sample statistical performance of DCS is superior to that of ARMA plus GARCH for most of the IT stocks. We also find that the out-of-sample density predictive performance of ARMA plus GARCH is never significantly superior to that of DCS. However, the predictive performance of DCS significantly dominates that of ARMA plus GARCH for several IT products.

The VaR forecasts are constructed based on daily, weekly, or biweekly returns of all constituent assets separately, gathered into portfolios based on asset class, or into a single portfolio. We compare the impact of aggregation with that of choosing a model for the conditional volatilities and correlations, the distribution for the innovations, and the method of forecast construction. We find that the level of temporal aggregation is most important. Daily returns form the best basis for VaR forecasts. Modeling the portfolio at the asset or asset class level works better than complete portfolio aggregation, but differences are smaller. The differences from the model, distribution, and forecast choices are also smaller compared with temporal aggregation. © The Author, 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

In risk measurement models there is usually a normal distribution together with some other distributions in a portfolio of risks. Exceedance probability or value-atrisk (VaR) calculations for these portfolios require simulations. However, with the use of the triangular approximation to the normal density we can have closed-form solutions for risk measurements using actuarial models that include not only insurance risk, such as gamma- and Pareto-distributed losses, but also financial risk. We also approximate the collective risk model under lognormally distributed severities and estimate its VaR. We evaluate the accuracy of the analytic solutions versus the Monte Carlo estimates and, according to our results, the analytic solutions requiring much less computational time are quite good. © 2017 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","Accurate modeling of the empirical distribution of crude oil market returns is extremely important in estimating risk measures. In addition to several commonly used distributions, alternative distributions are explored in this study, some of which account for the asymmetry and heavy tails simultaneously found in distributions, and contain more tail parameters to separately depict the right and left tails when forecasting the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of crude oil markets during highly volatile periods. Seven backtests are also conducted to compare the VaR forecasting accuracy among different distributions. The empirical results indicate that a highly volatile environment challenges the commonly used distributions, and the four risk models based on commonly used distributions are rejected about 27% to 38% of the time. The alternative distributions, i.e., skewed general error distributions (SGED), generalized hyperbolic skewed Student-t distributions (GHST), and generalized asymmetric Student-t (GAST) distributions, generally produce more accurate VaR measurement, and GAST gives the best measurement accuracy. The empirical results imply that risk managers or policymakers should further consider more flexible distributions, such as SGED, GHST, or GAST in particular, when quantifying or managing the risk in turbulent market times. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","We examine the performance of Islamic mutual funds in GCC countries using the Berk and Van Binsbergen (2015) value-added measure. We find compelling evidence that skilled managers exist in the Islamic mutual fund industry. The average mutual fund has used this skill to generate approximately $198,000 per month. The bootstrap methodology highlights that this performance is not obtained by chance. Finally, we document that in bad economic times, Islamic mutual funds have lower value-at-risk and higher Sharpe ratios than conventional benchmarks, supporting the claim that they are a means of hedging against international financial crises. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","In this paper we introduce the displaced historical simulation model which is designed to handle negative and close-to-zero risk factors. This is an issue of recent and major interest to the financial sector, both from a regulatory and financial institutions perspective, especially in light of observed negative values for major bond yield and interest rate spread time series. In historical simulation a common approach is to consider log returns (that is, relative changes), given that the risk factors remain positive. If a risk factor allows for negative values, log returns cannot be applied and one either ignores such scenarios or switches to considering absolute changes. The latter approach implies an abrupt model change. Our displaced historical simulation model strongly improves the historical simulation by “displacing” the shifts such that negative values can be handled, smoothly moving to the limit case of using absolute shifts instead of relative shifts of the original data. Our empirical results show that compared to other models presented in the literature, models equipped with our proposed displacement feature handle situations of close-to-zero or negative risk variables particularly well. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","In this paper, we assess the magnitude of model uncertainty of credit risk portfolio models, that is, what is the maximum and minimum value-at-risk (VaR) of a portfolio of risky loans that can be justified given a certain amount of available information. Puccetti and Rüschendorf [2012a. “Computation of Sharp Bounds on the Distribution of a Function of Dependent Risks”. Journal of Computational and Applied Maths 236, 1833–1840] and Embrechts, Puccetti, and Rüschendorf [2013. “Model Uncertainty and VaR Aggregation”. Journal of Banking and Finance 37, 2750–2764] propose the rearrangement algorithm (RA) as a general method to approximate VaR bounds when the loss distributions of the different loans are known but not their interdependence (unconstrained bounds). Their numerical results show that the gap between worst-case and best-case VaR is typically very high, a feature that can only be explained by lack of using dependence information. We propose a modification of the RA that makes it possible to approximate sharp VaR bounds when besides the marginal distributions also higher order moments of the aggregate portfolio such as variance and skewness are available as sources of dependence information. A numerical study shows that the use of moment information makes it possible to significantly improve the (unconstrained) VaR bounds. However, VaR assessments of credit portfolios that are performed at high confidence levels (as it is the case in Solvency II and Basel III) remain subject to significant model uncertainty and are not robust. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","This article proposes a Monte Carlo simulation based approach for measuring Value-at-Risk of a portfolio consisting of options and bonds. The approach allows for jump-diffusions in underlying assets and affords to fit a variety of model layout, including both non-parametric and semi-parametric structures. Backtesting was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the method. The algorithm was tested against various trading positions, time horizons, and correlations between asset prices and market return rates. A prominent advantage of our approach is that its implementation does not require prior knowledge of the joint distribution or other statistical features of the related risk factors. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","In this paper, a novel simulation-based methodology is proposed to test the validity of a set of marginal time series models, where the dependence structure between the time series is taken directly from the observed data. The procedure is useful when one wants to summarize the test results for several time series in one joint test statistic and p value. The proposed test method can have higher statistical power than a test for a univariate time series, especially for short time series. Therefore, our test for multiple time series is particularly useful if one wants to assess value-at-risk (or expected shortfall) predictions within a small time frame (eg, a crisis period). We apply our method to test generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model specifications for a large panel data set of stock returns. © 2017 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","Investors usually assign part of their funds to asset managers, who are given the task of beating a benchmark. Asset managers usually face a constraint on maximum tracking error volatility (TEV), which is imposed by the risk management office. In the mean– variance space, Jorion, in his 2003 paper “Portfolio optimization with tracking-error constraints”, shows that this constraint determines an ellipse containing all admissible portfolios. However, many admissible portfolios have problems in mean–variance terms, for example, because of an overly high variance. To overcome this problem, Jorion also fixes a constraint on variance, while, in their 2008 paper “Active portfolio management with benchmarking: adding a value-at-risk constraint”, Alexander and Baptista fix a constraint on value-at-risk (VaR). In this paper, I determine an optimal value for a set of limits composed of the lower limit on TEV, the upper limit on TEV and the upper limit on VaR. To fix the upper limit on VaR, I use the TEV constrained efficient frontier developed in Palomba and Riccetti’s 2013 paper “Asset management with TEV and VAR constraints: the constrained efficient frontiers”, which is the set of portfolios that is on Jorion’s ellipse and not dominated from the mean–variance perspective. In particular, I develop a strategy to impose on asset managers a set of portfolios that contains as many TEV constrained efficient portfolios and as few inefficient portfolios as possible. Moreover, I show that a limit on maximum VaR is usually better than a limit on maximum variance. © 2017 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","This paper provides a coherent method for scenario aggregation addressing model uncertainty. It is based on divergence minimization from a reference probability measure subject to scenario constraints.

This approach allows introducing changes of regimes in the conditional mean function of the inter-exceedance times (i.e., the time between two consecutive extreme events) in order to admit the presence of short- and long-term memory patterns. Further, through its multifractal structure, the MSM-POT approach is able to capture the typical stylized facts of extreme events observed in financial time series, such as temporal clustering of the size of exceedances and temporal behavior of tail thickness. We compare the performance of the MSM-POT model with competing self-exciting models and a GARCH-EVT approach in an in- and out-of-sample VaR forecasting exercise based on the extreme returns of six daily commodity futures prices (i.e. Brent and WTI crude oil, cocoa, cotton, copper, and gold). Empirical results suggest that the VaR estimates generated by the MSM-POT model for the returns analyzed produce the most accurate forecasts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","The price gap between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oil markets has been completely changed in the past several years. The price of WTI was always a little larger than that of Brent for a long time. However, the price of WTI has been surpassed by that of Brent since 2011. The new market circumstances and volatility of oil price require a comprehensive re-estimation of risk. Therefore, this study aims to explore an integrated approach to assess the price risk in the two crude oil markets through the value at risk (VaR) model. The VaR is estimated by the extreme value theory (EVT) and GARCH model on the basis of generalized error distribution (GED). The results show that EVT is a powerful approach to capture the risk in the oil markets. On the contrary, the traditional variance–covariance (VC) and Monte Carlo (MC) approaches tend to overestimate risk when the confidence level is 95%, but underestimate risk at the confidence level of 99%. The VaR of WTI returns is larger than that of Brent returns at identical confidence levels. Moreover, the GED-GARCH model can estimate the downside dynamic VaR accurately for WTI and Brent oil returns. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","Accurately measuring and forecasting value-at-risk (VaR) remains a challenging task at the heart of financial economic theory. Recently, quantile regression models have been used successfully to capture the conditional quantiles of returns and to forecast VaR accurately. In this paper, we further explore nonlinearities in data and propose to couple realized measures with the nonlinear quantile regression framework to explain and forecast the conditional quantiles of financial returns. The nonlinear quantile regression models are implied by the copula specifications and allow us to capture possible nonlinearities, tail dependence, and asymmetries in the conditional quantiles of financial returns. Using high frequency data that covers most liquid US stocks in seven sectors, we provide ample evidence of asymmetric conditional dependence with different levels of dependence, which are characteristic for each industry. The backtesting results of estimated VaR favour our approach. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2017.","(G)ARCH-type models are frequently used for the dynamic modelling and forecasting of risk attached to speculative asset returns. While the symmetric and conditionally Gaussian GARCH model has been generalized in a manifold of directions, model innovations are mostly presumed to stem from an underlying IID distribution. For a cross section of 18 stock market indices, we notice that (threshold) (T)GARCH-implied model innovations are likely at odds with the commonly held IID assumption. Two complementary strategies are pursued to evaluate the conditional distributions of consecutive TGARCH innovations, a non-parametric approach and a class of standardized copula distributions. Modelling higher order dependence patterns is found to improve standard TGARCH-implied conditional value-at-risk and expected shortfall out-of-sample forecasts that rely on the notion of IID innovations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","The aim of this paper is to reconsider the evidence on the forecasting ability of GARCH-type models in estimating the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of global stock market indices with improved return distribution. The performance of twenty-one VaR models that are generated by a combination of three conditional volatility specifications including GARCH, GJR and FIGARCH and seven distributional assumptions for return innovations is investigated. We implement stringent backtesting during crisis and post-crisis periods for developed, emerging and frontier markets. Results show that the skewed-t along with heavy-tailed Lévy distributions considerably improve the forecasts of one-day-ahead VaR for long and short trading positions during crisis period, regardless of the volatility model. However, we find no evidence that a given volatility specification outperforms the others across markets. The relevant models show evidence of long memory in developed markets and conditional asymmetry in frontier markets; whereas the standard GARCH is found to be the best suited specification for estimating VaR forecasts in emerging markets. The inclusion of high volatility period in the estimation sample highlights the predictability of VaR during post-crisis period, where even the normal distribution rivals the more sophisticated ones in terms of statistical accuracy and regulatory capital allocation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Although risk management has been explored thoroughly in financial modeling for over three decades, there is still a limited understanding of how to correctly quantify and manage the risks of investing in private equity, which continues to hinder our understanding of the risks associated with other traditional asset classes. This paper develops a comprehensive risk management framework for private equity fund investments, which captures the three main sources of risks that private equity investors face when investing in the asset class: market risk, liquidity risk and cashflow risk. Underlying the framework is a stochastic model for the value and cashflow dynamics of private equity funds, which allows us to derive three dynamic risk measures for private equity fund investments: value-at-risk, liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk and cashflow-at-risk. The model is calibrated with historical data of buyout funds, and the dynamics of the developed risk measures are illustrated for a single fund investment using Monte Carlo simulations. A model extension also studies the dynamics of the risk measures for portfolios of funds and develops a novel dynamic commitment strategy. Finally, sensitivity analyses show the impact of changes in the main model parameters on risk measures. © 2017 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","Multivariate volatility models can be evaluated via direct and indirect approaches. The former uses statistical loss functions (LFs) and a proxy to provide consistent estimates of the unobserved volatility. The latter uses utility LFs or other instruments, such as value-at-risk and its backtesting procedures. Existing studies commonly employ these procedures separately, focusing mostly on the multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (MGARCH) models. This work investigates and compares the two approaches in a model selection context. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation experiment is carried out, including MGARCH models based on daily returns and, extending the current literature, models that directly use the realized covariance, obtained from intraday returns. With reference to the direct approach, we rank the set of competing models empirically by means of four consistent statistical LFs and by reducing the quality of the volatility proxy. For the indirect approach, we use standard backtesting procedures to evaluate whether the number of value-at-risk violations is acceptable, and whether these violations are independently distributed over time. © 2017 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","In contrast to most of the existing literature that has concentrated empirically on the relationship between real estate investment trust (REIT) prices and the stock market, this paper directly models the effects of stock jumps on REIT returns associated with an alternative dynamic process. Three key features of the model are that it decomposes the impacts of stock jumps into two parts (the effect of jumps in the expected returns of REITs, and the influence of jumps in REIT volatility), it can efficiently describe the effect of stock returns on REITs according to Christoffersen's independence test during pre- and postcrisis periods; and the empirical results show that the magnitudes of jumps in expected returns and volatility are sensitive to the value-at-risk of REITs. Therefore, the effects of stock returns on expected returns and volatility of REITs cannot be neglected. © 2017. Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.

CoCos convert automatically into common equity or have a principal write-down when bank's regulatory capital fails to meet a predetermined level. They have been invented and put into legislation with an objective to absorb losses thus preventing institutions from bankruptcy. From the standpoint of an issuer CoCos bring about two counter effects regarding his solvency: on one hand they recapitalize a bank approaching insolvency on the other hand CoCos pay much higher coupon comparing to conventional bonds. In our model a bank has two funding alternatives: either to issue CoCos or conventional bonds. We measure issuer's default risk using the concept of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). We conclude that CoCos have the potential to strengthen the resilience of the issuer on the condition that the probability of conversion triggering is higher than the VaR's significance level. Our findings can be helpful to the policymakers and banks to better understand the impact of CoCos on issuer's solvency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Investor aversion to extreme losses may motivate them to seek out investments perceived to function as a safe haven during times of crisis. In this study, we consider the potential for precious metals to mitigate downside risk when combined with equities, and evaluate the impact on portfolio risk-adjusted returns. Each of gold, silver and platinum are found to contribute to downside risk reduction at short horizons, but diversification into silver and platinum may result in increased long horizon portfolio risk. The price of sheltering an equity portfolio from downside risk is a relative reduction in portfolio risk-adjusted returns.

We investigate the performance of inter-day and intra-day volatility models by estimating the AR(1)-GARCH(1,1)-skT and the AR(1)-HAR-RV-skT frameworks, respectively. This paper is based on the recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Regarding the forecasting performances, the exploitation of intra-day information does not appear to improve the accuracy of the VaR and ES forecasts for the 10-steps-ahead and 20-steps-ahead for the 95%, 97.5% and 99% significance levels. On the contrary, the GARCH specification, based on the inter-day information set, is the superior model for forecasting the multiple-days-ahead VaR and ES measurements. The intra-day volatility model is not as appropriate as it was expected to be for each of the different asset classes; stock indices, commodities and exchange rates. The multi-period VaR and ES forecasts are estimated for a range of datasets (stock indices, commodities, foreign exchange rates) in order to provide risk managers and financial institutions with information relating the performance of the inter-day and intra-day volatility models across various markets. The inter-day specification predicts VaR and ES measures adequately at a 95% confidence level. Regarding the 97.5% confidence level that has been recently proposed in the revised 2013 version of Basel III, the GARCH-skT specification provides accurate forecasts of the risk measures for stock indices and exchange rates, but not for commodities (that is Silver and Gold). In the case of the 99% confidence level, we do not achieve sufficiently accurate VaR and ES forecasts for all the assets. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","We show that diversification does not reduce Value-at-Risk for a large class of dependent heavy tailed risks.

In fact, solvency 2 framework has suggested some formulas to evaluate losses and solvency capital using an internal approach. However, these formulas where derived under the assumption of independent losses. Thus, the amount of capital may be inaccurate when losses are dependent, which is the case in practice. The aim of this paper is to investigate temporal dependence structure among claim amounts (losses). For that, a novel model named autoregressive conditional amount (ACA) model handling the dynamic behavior of claim amounts in insurance companies is proposed. Results show that ACA models allow to predict accurately the future claims. Moreover, a measure of risk namely value at risk (VaR) ACA that could hedge daily dependent losses is provided. By backtesting techniques, empirical results show that the new VaR ACA can efficiently evaluate the coverage amount of risks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","This paper examines the intertemporal relationship between downside risks and expected stock returns for five advanced markets. Using Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a measure of downside risk, we find a positive and significant relationship between VaR and the expected return before the world financial crisis (September 2008). However, when we estimate the model using a sample after this date, the results show a negative risk–return relationship. Evidence from a two-state Markov regime-switching model indicates that as uncertainty rises, the sign of the risk–return relationship turns negative. Evidence suggests that the Markov regime-switching model helps to resolve the conflicting signs in the risk–return relationship. © 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","We develop and test a new approach to assess defined benefit (DB) pension plan solvency risk in the presence of extreme market movements. Our method captures both the ‘fat-tailed’ nature of asset returns and their correlation with discount rate changes. We show that the standard assumption of constant discount rates leads to dramatic underestimation of future projections of pension plan solvency risk. Failing to incorporate leptokurtosis into asset returns also leads to downward biased estimates of risk, but this is less pronounced than the time-varying discount rate effect. Further modifying the model to capture the correlation between asset returns and the discount rate provides additional improvements in the projection of future pension plan solvency. This reduces the perceived future risk of underfunding because of the negative correlation between interest rate changes and asset returns. These results have important implications for those with responsibility for balancing risk against expected return when seeking to improve the current poor funding positions of DB pension schemes. © 2014 The Author(s).

But no loss can actually destroy more than the entire value of a bank or of a company, and this upper bound should be considered when dealing with tail-risk assessment. Introducing what we call the dual distribution, we show how to deal with heavy-tailed phenomena with a remote yet finite upper bound. We provide methods to compute relevant tail quantities such as the Expected Shortfall, which is not available under infinite-mean models, allowing adequate provisioning and capital allocation. This also permits a measurement of fragility. The main difference between our approach and a simple truncation is in the smoothness of the transformation between the original and the dual distribution. Our methodology is useful with apparently infinite-mean phenomena, as in the case of operational risk, but it can be applied in all those situations involving extreme fat tails and bounded support. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.","One of the main applications of conditional volatility modeling and forecasting of financial assets is the value-at-risk (VaR) estimation that is used by financial institutions for reporting the daily capital in risk. It remains a question on whether realized volatility (RV) models that incorporate the use of intraday data produce better VaR forecasts compared to methodologies that are based solely on daily returns. This study provides extensive comparison of out-of-sample volatility and VaR forecast performance on three equity market indices: S&amp;P500, FTSE100, and DAX30 using 13 risk models that consist of 5 GARCH specifications, 4 ARFIMAX specifications and 4 HARX specifications. The out-of-sample volatility forecasts are evaluated by various loss functions and simple scoring procedures in order to identity the model that produces the overall best volatility forecasts. For VaR forecasts, the models are evaluated using a two-stage backtesting procedure where the models undergo unconditional and conditional coverage tests to eliminate underperforming models and the qualified models are then evaluated using the quadratic probability score (QPS) function that is computed based on various VaR loss functions. The results showed that RV models outperform GARCH models for volatility forecasts, but a simple EGARCH model outperforms the rest models for most of the VaR forecasts. The results also indicated that capturing the asymmetric behavior of volatility dynamics is essential for accurate volatility and VaR forecasts. The findings of this study provide useful information for market risk regulation, financial risk management and further investigations such as extension to derivative markets and options pricing. © 2016 China Science Publishing &amp; Media Ltd.","This article develops a new test to evaluate value-at-risk (VaR) forecasts.

Essentially, P&amp;L from model risk corresponds to P&amp;L realized on a perfectly hedged position. Model uncertainty is expressed by a set of pricing models, each of which represents alternative asset price dynamics to the model used for pricing. P&amp;L from model risk is determined relative to each of these models. Using market data, a unified loss distribution is attained by weighing models according to a likelihood criterion involving both calibration quality and model parsimony.

While previous analyses show that EVT methods often lead to accurate estimates for risk measures, a potential drawback lies in large standard errors of the point estimates in these methods, as only a fraction of the data set is used. Thus, we comprehensively study the impact of model risk on EVT methods when determining the value-at-risk and expected shortfall. We distinguish between first-order effects of model risk, which consist of misspecification and estimation risk, and second-order effects of model risk, which refer to the dispersion of risk measure estimates, and show that EVT methods are less prone to first-order effects. However, they show a greater sensitivity toward secondorder effects.We find that this can lead to severe value-at-risk and expected shortfall underestimations and should be reflected in regulatory capital models. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","We expand the literature of volatility and Value-at-Risk forecasting of oil price returns by comparing the recently proposed Mixture Memory GARCH (MMGARCH) model to other discrete volatility models (GARCH, RiskMetrics, EGARCH, APARCH, FIGARCH, HYGARCH, and FIAPARCH). We incorporate an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for parameter estimation of the MMGARCH and find different structures in volatility level as well as shock persistence. MMGARCH is also able to cover asymmetric and long memory effects. Furthermore, a dissimilar memory structure in variance of WTI and Brent crude oil prices is observed which is supported by additional tests. Parameter estimation and comparison of the models reveal significant long memory and asymmetry in oil price returns. In regard of variance forecasting and Value-at-Risk prediction, it is shown that MMGARCH outperforms the aforementioned models due to its dynamic approach in varying the volatility level and memory of the process. We find MMGARCH superior for application in risk management as a result of its flexibility in adjusting to variance shifts and shocks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","This paper examines a comparative risk forecast experiment for Asian stock markets. Apart from the literature, this work extends previous methods to propose a Switching forecast model to increase forecast effectiveness. The Switching forecast model is explicitly designed to estimate the forecasting problem faced by the risk manager who does not rely on a specific Value-at-Risk (VaR) model and allows for the VaR model to change over time. It is found that the Switching forecast model is not only capable of capturing the characteristics of Asian stock markets but also provides a satisfactorily accurate measurement based on coverage tests. Additionally, the superiority test indicates statistically that the Switching forecast model is more effective than alternative models based on quadratic loss function. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","We propose a framework for estimating time-varying systemic risk contributions that is applicable to a high-dimensional and interconnected financial system. Tail risk dependencies and systemic risk contributions are estimated using a penalized two-stage fixed-effects quantile approach, which explicitly links time-varying interconnectedness to systemic risk contributions. For the purposes of surveillance and regulation of financial systems, network dependencies in extreme risks are more relevant than simple (mean) correlations. Thus, the framework provides a tool for supervisors, reflecting the market's view of tail dependences and systemic risk contributions. The model is applied to a system of 51 large European banks and 17 sovereigns during the period from 2006 through 2013, utilizing both equity and CDS prices. We provide new evidence on how banking sector fragmentation and sovereign-bank linkages evolved over the European sovereign debt crisis, and how they are reflected in estimated network statistics and systemic risk measures. Finally, our evidence provides an indication that the fragmentation of the European financial system has peaked. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","In this study, we estimate the multi-period Value at Risk (VaR) of oil future prices under a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity with a skewed- (Formula presented.) residuals (GARCH-ST) model, which is developed to account for the stylized facts of oil futures returns, such as serial correlation, volatility clustering, asymmetry and heavy tails. An efficient approximation algorithm based on the moment calibration method is developed to compute the multi-period VaR, and the numerical experiments show that the algorithm can yield good approximation quality. In the empirical analysis, we find that the GARCH-ST model can yield superior out-of-sample performance to a GARCH-normal model or a GARCH- (Formula presented.) model, especially when measuring the extreme tail risk. Meanwhile, the square root of time rule (SRTR) tends to underestimate the multi-period tail risk, and cannot produce a better performance than the GARCH family models. © 2016 Taylor &amp; Francis.","In this article we evaluate the daily conditional volatility and h-step-ahead Value at Risk (VaR) forecasting power of three long memory GARCH-type models (FIGARCH, HYGARCH &amp; FIAPARCH). The forecasting exercise is done for financial assets including seven stock indices (Dow Jones, Nasdaq100, S&amp;P 500, DAX30, CAC40, FTSE100 and Nikkei 225) and three exchange rates vis-a-vis the US dollar (the GBP- USD, YEN-USD and Euro-USD). Because all return series are skewed and fat tailed, each conditional volatility model is estimated under a skewed Student distribution. Consistent with the idea that the accuracy of VaR estimates are sensitive to the adequacy of the volatility model used, h-step-ahead VaR forecasts are based on the skewed Student-t AR(1)-FIAPARCH (1,d,1). This model can jointly accounts for the salient features of financial time series. Our findings reveal that the skewed Student AR (1) FIAPARCH (1.d.1) relatively outperforms the other models in out-of-sample forecasts for one, five and fifteen day forecast horizons. However, there is no difference for the AR (1) FIGARCH (1.d.1) and AR (1) HYGARCH (1.d.1) models since they have the same forecasting ability. Results indicate also that skewed Student-t FIAPARCH (1,d,1) model provides more accurate one-day-ahead VaR forecasts for both long and short trading positions than those generated using alternative horizons (5-day and 15-day-ahead). This result holds for each of the financial time series. © 2016 China Science Publishing &amp; Media Ltd.","CoVaR is a measure for systemic risk of the networked financial system conditional on institutions being under distress. The analysis of systemic risk is the focus of recent econometric analyses and uses tail event and network based techniques. Here, in this paper we bring tail event and network dynamics together into one context. In order to pursue such joint efforts, we propose a semiparametric measure to estimate systemic interconnectedness across financial institutions based on tail-driven spillover effects in a high dimensional framework. The systemically important institutions are identified conditional to their interconnectedness structure. Methodologically, a variable selection technique in a time series setting is applied in the context of a single-index model for a generalized quantile regression framework. We could thus include more financial institutions into the analysis to measure their tail event interdependencies and, at the same time, be sensitive to non-linear relationships between them. Network analysis, its behaviour and dynamics, allows us to characterize the role of each financial industry group in 2007-2012: the depositories received and transmitted more risk among other groups, the insurers were less affected by the financial crisis. The proposed TENET - Tail Event driven NETwork technique allows us to rank the Systemic Risk Receivers and Systemic Risk Emitters in the US financial market. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First, we use some goodness-of-fit tests to analyze which distribution best fits the data. The comparisons in terms of VaR are carried out by examining the accuracy of the VaR estimate and minimizing the loss function from the points of view of the regulator and the firm. The results show that the skewed distributions outperform the normal and Student t (ST) distributions in fitting portfolio returns. Following a two-stage selection process, whereby we initially ensure that the distributions provide accurateVaR estimates, and focusing on the firm’s loss function, we can conclude that skewed distributions outperform the normal and ST distributions in forecasting VaR. From the point of view of the regulator, the superiority of the skewed distributions related to ST is not evident. As the firms are free to choose the model they use to forecast VaR, in practice, skewed distributions will be used more frequently. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","It has become important for ethanol producers to hedge input and output price risks. The purpose of this paper is to analyze an ethanol-producing firm's strategy to reduce price risks for inputs and outputs. Corn is the primary input, and the outputs are ethanol, corn oil, distillers' dried grains (DDGs), and renewable identification numbers (RINs). A theoretical model is developed including margins and risk is measured using value at risk (VaR). An empirical model is developed and extended to VaR using copulas to analyze the marginal distribution and dependence structure for input and output prices on margins. Efficient frontier curves analyzing VaR with and without copula are discussed. The results compare varying risk-strategy measures for long corn, short corn, and combining short and long corn. Sensitivity analyses are conducted for functional changes in the margin as a result of ethanol price changes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","The choice of an appropriate dependence structure in modelling multivariate risks is an important issue because different tail structure embedded in copula leads to a different capital requirement for the institution.

The main emphasis of the study has been given to Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and to evaluate how well Conditional EVT model performs in modeling tails of distributions and in estimating and forecasting intraday VaR and ES measures. We have followed McNeil and Frey's (2000) two stage approach called Conditional EVT to estimate dynamic intraday VaR and ES. We have compared the accuracy of Conditional EVT approach to intraday VaR and ES estimation with other competing models. The best performing model is found to be the Conditional EVT in estimating both the quantiles for the entire sample. The study is useful for market participants (such as intraday traders and market makers) involved in frequent intraday trading in such equity markets. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","This article applies realized volatility forecasting to Extreme Value Theory (EVT). We propose a two-step approach where returns are first pre-whitened with a high-frequency based volatility model, and then an EVT based model is fitted to the tails of the standardized residuals. This realized EVT approach is compared to the conditional EVT of McNeil &amp; Frey (2000). We assess both approaches' ability to filter the dependence in the extremes and to produce stable out-of-sample VaR and ES estimates for one-day and ten-day time horizons. The main finding is that GARCH-type models perform well in filtering the dependence, while the realized EVT approach seems preferable in forecasting, especially at longer time horizons. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","We discuss the application of orthogonal polynomials to the estimation of probability density functions, particularly with regard to accessing features of a portfolio’s profit/loss distribution. Such expansions are given by the sum of known orthogonal polynomials multiplied by an associated weight function. However, naive applications of expansion methods are flawed. The shape of the estimator’s tail can undulate under the influence of the constituent polynomials in the expansion, and it can even exhibit regions of negative density. This paper presents techniques to remedy these flaws and improve the quality of risk estimation.We show that by targeting a smooth density that is sufficiently close to the target density, we can obtain expansion-based estimators that do not have the shortcomings of equivalent naive estimators. In particular, we apply optimization and smoothing techniques that place greater weight on the tails than on the body of the distribution. Numerical examples using both real and simulated data illustrate our approach. We further outline how our techniques can apply to a wide class of expansion methods and indicate opportunities to extend to the multivariate case, where distributions of individual component risk factors in a portfolio can be accessed for the purpose of risk management. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","The required solvency capital for a financial portfolio is typically given by a tail risk measure such as value-at-risk. Estimating the value of that risk measure from a limited, often small, sample of data gives rise to potential errors in the selection of the statistical model and the estimation of its parameters. We propose to quantify the effectiveness of a capital estimation procedure via the notions of residual estimation risk and estimated capital risk. It is shown that, for capital estimation procedures that do not require the specification of a model (eg, historical simulation) or for worst-case scenario procedures, the impact of model uncertainty is substantial, while capital estimation procedures that allow for multiple candidate models using Bayesian methods partially eliminate model error. In the same setting, we propose a way of quantifying model error that allows us to disentangle the impact of model uncertainty from that of parameter uncertainty. We illustrate these ideas by simulation examples considering standard loss and return distributions used in banking and insurance. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","This paper proposes a parsimonious quantile regression model for forecasting Value-at-Risk. The model uses only observable measures of daily, weekly, and monthly volatility as input and thus simplifies optimization substantially compared with other methods proposed in the literature. The framework also provides a new way of illustrating the volatility effects of a heterogeneous market. When subjected to formal coverage tests for out-of-sample VaR predictions, model performance is similar to more complicated models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","The optimal capital growth strategy or Kelly strategy has many desirable properties such as maximizing the asymptotic long-run growth of capital. However, it has considerable short-run risk since the utility is logarithmic, with essentially zero Arrow–Pratt risk aversion. It is common to control risk with a Value-at-Risk (VaR) constraint defined on the end of horizon wealth. A more effective approach is to impose a VaR constraint at each time on the wealth path. In this paper, we provide a method to obtain the maximum growth while staying above an ex-ante discrete time wealth path with high probability, where shortfalls below the path are penalized with a convex function of the shortfall. The effect of the path VaR condition and shortfall penalties is a lower growth rate than the Kelly strategy, but the downside risk is under control. The asset price dynamics are defined by a model with Markov transitions between several market regimes and geometric Brownian motion for prices within a regime. The stochastic investment model is reformulated as a deterministic programme which allows the calculation of the optimal constrained growth wagers at discrete points in time. © 2015 Taylor &amp; Francis.","This study examines the role of higher order moments in the returns of four important metals, aluminium, copper, gold and silver, using the asymmetric GARCH (AGARCH) model with a conditional skewed generalized-t (SGT) distribution. Implications of higher order moments in metal returns are evaluated by comparing the performances of conditional value-at-risk measures obtained from the AGARCH models with SGT distributions to those obtained from the AGARCH models with normal and student-t distributions. With the exception of gold, the AGARCH model with the SGT distribution appears to have the best fit for all metals examined. © 2015 Taylor &amp; Francis.","In this paper, we investigate the four most commonly used risk measures - return volatility, beta, value-at-risk and stressed value-at-risk - of a time series momentum (TSM) trading strategy. We demonstrate that the TSM strategy results in reduced risk measures compared with the passive buy-and-hold strategy. We then validate the hypothesis with a bivariate risk model of AR(1) processes. The reduction in risk measures ranged from 24% to 46% under the given model of AR(1) processes. These findings should be relevant to portfolio managers, traders or risk managers who are interested in managing the financial risk of trading strategies based on TSM.","This paper evaluates the model risk of models used for forecasting systemic and market risk. Model risk, which is the potential for different models to provide inconsistent outcomes, is shown to be increasing with market uncertainty. During calm periods, the underlying risk forecast models produce similar risk readings; hence, model risk is typically negligible. However, the disagreement between the various candidate models increases significantly during market distress, further frustrating the reliability of risk readings. Finally, particular conclusions on the underlying reasons for the high model risk and the implications for practitioners and policy makers are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","This case study examines the applicability of a wide range of value-at-risk (VaR) models in emerging markets, using the South Eastern European countries as examples. The aim of the paper is to get answers to two questions. The first question is whether VaR models that are created and suited to developed markets can be used reliably in emerging markets, such as the South Eastern European countries. The second question is whether modifications can improve their applicability to these markets. The results show that the most popular and widely used VaR models are not well suited to measuring market risk in the South Eastern European countries, and it is necessary to use the most appropriate VaR model for measuring market risk in these markets. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","This paper discusses a value-at-risk (VaR) time-scaling approach based on fitting a distribution function so as to apply a Monte Carlo simulation to determine long-term VaR.

We estimate valueat- risk (VaR), one of the most popular concepts in the area of risk management, for FX rate returns. To enhance the robustness of the estimation results, we use other VaR models, such as historical simulation, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model and conditional extreme value theory (EVT). Our four methodologies are applied to three major foreign exchange rates (EUR/JPY, EUR/USD and USD/JPY) by using a different size estimation windows for each model to forecast one-day-ahead VaR. We propose a new procedure to find the best size of estimation window for each VaR model, with which we compare the respective VaR estimates. The conditional EVT and CGMY distributions provide superior forecasting performance for all three rates's daily returns, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of the other methods can be significantly improved by adjusting the size of the estimation window. © 2016 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","Loan syndication increases bank interconnectedness through co-lending relationships. We study the financial stability implications of such dependency on syndicate partners in the presence of shocks to banks’ capital. Model simulations in a network setting show that such shocks can produce rare events in this market when banks have shared loan exposures while also relying on a common risk management tool such as value-at-risk (VaR). This is because a withdrawal of a bank from a syndicate can cause ripple effects through the market, as the loan arranger scrambles to commit more of its own funds by also pulling back from other syndicates or has to dissolve the syndicate it had arranged. However, simulations also show that the core-periphery structure observed in the empirical network may reduce the probability of such contagion. In addition, simulations with tighter VaR constraints show banks taking on less risk ex-ante. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","The purpose of this paper is to dispel some common misunderstandings about capital adequacy rules based on Expected Shortfall. We establish that, from a theoretical perspective, Expected Shortfall based regulation can provide a misleading assessment of tail behavior, does not necessarily protect liability holders' interests much better than Value-at-Risk based regulation, and may also allow for regulatory arbitrage when used as a global solvency measure. We also show that, for a value-maximizing financial institution, the benefits derived from protecting its franchise may not be sufficient to disincentivize excessive risk taking. We further interpret our results in the context of portfolio risk measurement. Our results do not invalidate the possible merits of Expected Shortfall as a risk measure but instead highlight the need for its cautious use in the context of capital adequacy regimes and of portfolio risk control. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","This paper investigates how the conditional quantiles of future returns and volatility of financial assets vary with various measures of ex post variation in asset prices as well as option-implied volatility.

Our results for the S &amp; P 500 andWTI Crude Oil futures contracts show that simple linear quantile regressions for returns and heterogenous quantile autoregressions for realized volatility perform very well in capturing the dynamics of the respective conditional distributions, both in absolute terms as well as relative to a couple of well-established benchmark models.

We find that high interest rate currencies are related to innovations in global currency tail risk. They deliver low returns in times of unexpected high tail risk and high returns in times of unexpected low tail risk suggesting a standard Asset Pricing Theory approach to explain the returns to the carry trade. Our tail risk factor can be understood as the interaction of moment-based factors such as volatility, skewness and kurtosis. Our results tend to indicate that the interaction of moments, i.e. tail risk, rather than the moments alone drives investor behavior. This makes sense since the ultimate risk for carry traders is to reach their funding limits which are set, because of the regulations, on the back of tail risk statistics (Value at Risk) and not simply on the back of the volatility, the skewness or the kurtosis alone. The result holds in other cross-sections of currencies and whether the global tail risk indicators are estimated in the currency, the equity or the bond market. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","We suggest a simple improvement of recent VaR-backtesting procedures based on time intervals between VaR-violations and show via Monte Carlo that our test has more power than its competitors against various empirically relevant clustering alternatives. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","We propose to compute the Intraday Value-at-Risk (IVaR) for stocks using real-time transaction data.

We focus on the least absolute deviation quantile estimator and show that while the underlying process is a sequence of stationary martingale differences, the estimation errors are asymptotically normal with the convergence rate which is slower than n and determined by the dependence parameter of the volatility sequence. A non-parametric resampling method is employed to estimate the normalizing constants by which the confidence intervals are constructed. To demonstrate the methodology, we conduct a simulation study as well as an empirical analysis of the Value-at-Risk estimate of the S&amp;P 500 daily returns. Both are consistent with the theoretical findings and provide clear evidence that the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals for the quantile estimate are severely biased if the strong dependence of the unobserved volatility sequence is ignored. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","In this paper, we adopt a smooth non-parametric estimation to explore the safety-first portfolio optimization problem.

We numerically and empirically test our non-parametric method to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. Cross-validation results show that our non-parametric kernel estimation method outperforms the empirical distribution method.

Using the Generalized Pareto Distribution for the return innovations, we use a GARCH model for the conditional market return components of major stock markets covering the U.S., France, Germany and Japan. Testing for fat-tails and tail index equality, we find that overnight return innovations exhibit significant tail risk, while intraday innovations do not. We illustrate this volatility versus tail risk trade-off based on conditional Value-at-Risk calculations. Our results show that overnight downside market risk is composed of a moderate volatility risk component and a significant tail risk component. We conclude that market participants face different intraday versus overnight risk profiles and that a risk assessment based on volatility only will severely underestimate overnight downside risk. © 2015.","We have analyzed extreme movements of the main stocks traded in the Eurozone in the 2000-2012 period.

Specially, we find sectors in general where companies have very high (telecommunications and banking) and very low (petroleum, utilities, energy and consumption) estimated VaR values. Second, we only find differences according to the geographical situation of where the stocks are traded in two countries: (1) all firms in the Irish stock market (the only financially rescued country we analyze) have very high estimated VaR values in all sectors; while (2) in Spain all firms have very low estimated VaR values included in the banking and the telecommunication sectors.

In this paper, we put forward two strategies for improving HS in these weak areas with only minor additional computational costs. The first strategy is a “ghosted” scenario and the second is a two-component (short-run and long-run) exponentially weighted moving average scheme.

Supported by a variety of robustness checks, we gain three important insights for portfolio managers investing in equity and commodity markets. First, even though POT methods are known to yield more precise VaR estimates than classic techniques based on the normal distribution assumption or historical simulation, all techniques yield almost identical rankings. Second, even though the choice of threshold crucially influences VaR estimates, it does not significantly change asset rankings. These two results are most pronounced when the portfolio manager’s focus is on identifying the best or worst assets in terms of VaR. Third, unconditional and conditional POT approaches differ considerably in the rankings they generate.

In particular, we allow correlations between volatility components to be non-homogeneous with two different parameters governing the volatility correlations at high and low frequencies. Specification tests confirm the added explanatory value of this specification. In order to explore its practical performance, we apply the model for computing value-at-risk statistics for different classes of financial assets and compare the results with the baseline, homogeneous bivariate multifractal model and the bivariate DCC-GARCH of Engle [2002. “Dynamic Conditional Correlation: A Simple Class of Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity Models.” Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics 20 (3): 339–350].

We adopt three long-memory-models including, FIGARCH, HYGARCH and FIAPARCH to forecast energy commodity volatility by capturing some volatility stylized fact such as long-range memory, heteroscedasticity, asymmetry and fat-tails. Then we consider extreme value theory which concentrates on the tail distribution rather than the entire distribution. EVT is considered as a potential framework for the separate treatment of tails of distributions which allows for asymmetry. Our results show that the FIAPARCH model with extreme value theory performs better in predicting the one-day-ahead VaR. Using the fitted long-memory GARCH-model and a simulation approach to estimate VaR for horizons over than one day, backtesting results show that our approach still performs for lower estimation frequencies. Overall, our findings confirm that taking into account long-range memory, asymmetry and fat tails in the behavior of energy commodity prices returns combined with filtering process such as EVT are important in improving risk management assessments and hedging strategies in the high volatile energy market. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","To date, an operational measure of systemic risk capturing nonlinear tail-comovements between system-wide and individual bank returns has not yet been developed. This paper proposes an extension of the CoVaR methodology in Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011) to capture the asymmetric response of the banking system to positive and negative shocks to the market-valued balance sheets of individual banks. Building on a comprehensive sample of U.S. banks in the period 1990-2010, the evidence in this paper shows that ignoring asymmetries that feature tail-interdependences may lead to a severe underestimation of systemic risk. On average, the relative impact on the system of a fall in individual market value is sevenfold that of an increase. Moreover, the downward bias in systemic-risk measuring from ignoring this asymmetric pattern increases with bank size. In particular, the conditional tail-comovement between the banking system and a bank that is losing market value belonging to the top size-sorted decile is nearly 5.5 times larger than the unconditional tail-comovement versus 3.3 times for banks in the bottom decile. The asymmetric model also produces much better fitting, with the restriction that gives rise to the standard symmetric model being rejected for most firms in the sample, particularly, in the segment of large-scale banks. This result is important from a regulatory and supervisory perspective, since the asymmetric generalization enhances the capacity to monitor systemic interdependences. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Methodological-empirical analysis of risk management in Islamic banking is rather scarce. This is due to either a lack of comprehensive understanding in the latest development of empirical modeling or analysts’failure to grasp the underlying assumptions that underpin the model. Such an inability could be detrimental, particularly in the investigation of operational risk exposures in Islamic banking. This study therefore contributes to this field by deliberating upon a proposed delta-gamma sensitivity analysis-extreme value theory (DGSA-EVT) model that focuses on the assessment of risk exposures represented by the value of value-at-risk (VaR) in three incomegenerating channels: one in investment, one in financing and one in services. A data analysis demonstrates that risk variables in this study exhibit nonnormality, which understandably does not fit with the underlying assumption of VaR, namely the normality of the variables under the analysis. Hence, in order to mitigate this, our study employs a parametric approach called the Cornish-Fisher expansion, under which the confidence interval of assigned risk variables is a function of their respective skewness, kurtosis and volatility. Such an approach has proven to be effective in mitigating the likelihood of over- or underestimating theVaR in the income-generation channels analyzed as a result of misaddressing the nonnormality of risk variables. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","As far as asset and liability management is concerned, the advanced analysis of the risk and return profile of Islamic financing and investment products today constitutes one of the greatest challenges for Islamic financial institutions. Given the fact that, by design, Islamic financial institutions should be keeping a handsome portion of their assets in equity investments, this paper brings out the dynamics of a specific risk profile inherent in Islamic equity investment based on investing in the sharia-compliant stock market. Therefore, we investigate three Islamic equity indexes, classified by economic hubs (Dow Jones Europe, Asia/Pacific and United States), against their conventional peers from 2003 to 2009. Our risk profile analysis is based on the estimation of two well-known advanced risk measures, namely value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). FourVaR methodologies are used: historicalVaR, RiskMetrics, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity conditional VaR models and the Cornish-Fisher VaR model. The models’ assessments, based on the Kupiec (1995) test, allow us to better investigate the equity indexes’ daily returns tails through the estimation of the generalized Pareto distributionVaR and ES measures. The end result of our advanced risk profile analysis is that Islamic equity indexes seem to depict a regional, as well as a periodic, character risk profile. Drawing from the specific features of the Dow Jones Islamic indexes and their compounds’ inherent features, this paper argues that sharia screening, which alters the composition of Islamic indexes, contributes to the shaping of a distinguished risk profile. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","The Basel III Accord requires that banks and other Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) communicate their daily risk forecasts to the appropriate monetary authorities at the beginning of each trading day, using one of a range of alternative risk models to forecast Value-at-Risk (VaR). The risk estimates from these models are used to determine the daily capital charges (DCC) and associated capital costs of ADIs, depending in part on the number of previous violations, whereby realized losses exceed the estimated VaR. In this paper we define risk management in terms of choosing sensibly from a variety of risk models and discuss the optimal selection of the risk models. Previous approaches to model selection for predicting VaR proposed combining alternative risk models and ranking such models on the basis of average DCC, or other quantiles of its distribution. These methods are based on the first moment, or specific quantiles of the DCC distribution, and supported by restrictive evaluation functions. In this paper, we consider robust uniform rankings of models over large classes of loss functions that may reflect different weights and concerns over different intervals of the distribution of losses and DCC. The uniform rankings are based on recently developed statistical tests of stochastic dominance (SD). The SD tests are illustrated using the prices and returns of VIX futures. The empirical findings show that the tests of SD can rank different pairs of models to a statistical degree of confidence, and that the alternative (recentered) SD tests are in general agreement. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","The Copula-MGARCH (C-MGARCH) model by Lee and Long (2009) incorporates standardized copula distributed innovations in MGARCH models. We motivate an extension of the C-MGARCH model by means of a continuous decomposition of the innovations' covariance matrix. An extended BEKK(1, 1) model with rotated standardized innovations is outlined for the bivariate case. The model parameters and the rotation angle are jointly estimated by means of Maximum Likelihood. We conduct an application to the log-differences of Euro/US-Dollar and Japanese Yen/US-Dollar daily exchange rates. In-sample information criteria and ex-ante portfolio Value-at-Risk coverage tests show that the enhanced flexibility of the rotated C-MGARCH is supported by the data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","We propose a novel approach to measure risk in fixed income portfolios in terms of value-at-risk (VaR). We obtain closed-form expressions for the vector of expected bond returns and for its covariance matrix based on a general class of dynamic factor models, including the dynamic versions of the Nelson-Siegel and Svensson models, to compute the parametric VaR of a portfolio composed of fixed income securities. The proposed approach provides additional modeling flexibility as it can accommodate alternative specifications of the yield curve as well as alternative specifications of the conditional heteroskedasticity in bond returns. An empirical application involving a data set with 15 fixed income securities with different maturities indicate that the proposed approach delivers accurate VaR estimates. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","This paper proposes a two-step methodology for Value-at-Risk prediction. The first step involves estimation of a GARCH model using quasi-maximum likelihood estimation and the second step uses model filtered returns with the skewed t distribution of Azzalini and Capitanio [J. R. Stat. Soc. B, 2003, 65, 367–389]. The predictive performance of this method is compared to the single-step joint estimation of the same data generating process, to the well-known GARCH-Evt model and to a comprehensive set of other market risk models. Backtesting results show that the proposed two-step method outperforms most benchmarks including the classical joint estimation method of same data generating process and it performs competitively with respect to the GARCH-Evt model. This paper recommends two robust models to risk managers of emerging market stock portfolios. Both models are estimated in two steps: the GJR-GARCH-Evt model and the two-step GARCH-St model proposed in this study. © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.","The (marginal) risk contribution is very useful for analyzing the concentration risk in a portfolio. However, it is difficult to estimate the risk contributions for value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) precisely, especially using a Monte Carlo simulation. We applied a saddlepoint approximation to estimate the distribution function, so that the difficulty of estimating the risk contributions for VaR was dissolved. In this paper, we propose new estimation methods for ES and the risk contributions for ES based on the conditional independence and a saddlepoint approximation. Numerical studies confirm that these new methods are much better than existing ones. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","This paper proposes a set of Value-at-Risk (VaR) models appropriate to capture the dynamics of energy prices and subsequently quantify energy price risk by calculating VaR and expected shortfall measures. Amongst the competing VaR methodologies evaluated in this paper, besides the commonly used benchmark models, a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach and a hybrid MC with historical simulation approach, both assuming various processes for the underlying spot prices, are also being employed. All VaR models are empirically tested on eight spot energy commodities that trade futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the constructed Spot Energy Index. A two-stage evaluation and selection process is applied, combining statistical and economic measures, to choose amongst the competing VaR models. Finally, both long and short trading positions are considered as it is of utmost importance for energy traders and risk managers to be able to capture efficiently the characteristics of both tails of the distributions. © 2013, Taylor &amp; Francis.","The computation of Value at Risk has traditionally been a troublesome issue in commercial real estate. Difficulties mainly arise from the lack of appropriate data, the non-normality of returns, and the inapplicability of many of the traditional methodologies. As a result, calculation of this risk measure has rarely been done in the real estate field. However, following a spate of new regulations such as Basel II, Basel III, NAIC and Solvency II, financial institutions have increasingly been required to estimate and control their exposure to market risk. As a result, financial institutions now commonly use “internal” Value at Risk (VaR) models in order to assess their market risk exposure. The purpose of this paper is to estimate distribution functions of real estate VaR while taking into account non-normality in the distribution of returns. This is accomplished by the combination of the Cornish-Fisher expansion with a certain rearrangement procedure. We demonstrate that this combination allows superior estimation, and thus a better VaR estimate, than has previously been obtainable. We also show how the use of a rearrangement procedure solves well-known issues arising from the monotonicity assumption required for the Cornish-Fisher expansion to be applicable, a difficulty which has previously limited the useful of this expansion technique. Thus, practitioners can find a methodology here to quickly assess Value at Risk without suffering loss of relevancy due to any non-normality in their actual return distribution. The originality of this paper lies in our particular combination of Cornish-Fisher expansions and the rearrangement procedure. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","We propose to forecast the Value-at-Risk of bivariate portfolios using copulas which are calibrated on the basis of nonparametric sample estimates of the coefficient of lower tail dependence. We compare our proposed method to a conventional copula-GARCH model where the parameter of a Clayton copula is estimated via Canonical Maximum-Likelihood. The superiority of our proposed model is exemplified by analyzing a data sample of nine different bivariate and one nine-dimensional financial portfolio. A comparison of the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy of both models confirms that our model yields economically significantly better Value-at-Risk forecasts than the competing parametric calibration strategy. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Multivariate volatilities and distribution play an important role in portfolio selection and can be used to calculate the value-at-risk (VaR) of a multiple-asset financial position. This study proposes a new expected utility maximization (EUM) model that accounts for VaR (EUM model with a VaR constraint (EUM–VaR)). Additionally, using the EUM–VaR model, this study investigates the hedging effectiveness of short and long hedged portfolios constructed with multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-type models that feature level effects and multivariate normal (Formula presented.) and skewed (Formula presented.) distributions for stock indexes and their corresponding futures in the Greater China Region. It is found that, all else equal, portfolios constructed using the multivariate skewed (Formula presented.) distribution are far more effective in hedging than those that rely on the other distributions, and the effectiveness of hedged portfolios from the multivariate GARCH-type models with level effects outperform those without level effects. Additionally, the effectiveness of hedged portfolios from multivariate asymmetric GARCH-type models exceeds that of those from multivariate symmetric GARCH-type models. Thus, investors should select the multivariate asymmetry in volatility, multivariate asymmetry in distribution, and EUM–VaR models to construct effectively hedged portfolios. The results of this study can provide useful implications for investors looking to manage risk. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Expanding the realized variance concept through realized skewness and kurtosis is a straightforward process. We calculate one-day forecasts for these moments with a simple exponentially weighted moving average approach. Once the forecasts are computed, we apply them in a method of moments to fit a sophisticated distribution. The normal inverse Gaussian distribution is appropriate for this purpose because it exhibits higher moments, and a simple analytical solution for the method of moments exists.We then calculate the value-at-risk for the Deutsche Aktienindex (DAX) using this technique. Although the model is comparatively simple, the empirical analysis shows good results in terms of backtesting. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","This paper develops an indirect inference (Gourieroux et al.; 1993; Smith, 1993) estimation method for a large class of dynamic equilibria. Our approach consists of constructing econometrically tractable auxiliary equilibria, obtained by simplifying the economic primitives of the structural equilibrium model, via which estimation can proceed. We use this approach to develop an accurate estimator for the long-run risk model of Bansal and Yaron (2004). We demonstrate the method in Monte Carlo simulations and implement it on U.S. data. We also illustrate the good performance of the proposed methodology on an equilibrium model with investor learning. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Then the quantiles are evaluated by utilizing Secant numerical approach to solve this nonlinear equation. Subsequently, the exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model with GT distribution is utilized to estimate the corresponding volatility, and further estimate the value-at-risk (VaR) of seven stock indices in the developed and emerging markets. Empirical results show that, the stylized facts that appeared in most financial assets are seized effectively by this model and negative return and volatility spillover effects significantly subsist from the currency markets to stock markets. Moreover, the stock indices in emerging market have the higher return and the higher risk. As to VaR performance comparison, the modified historical simulation (MHS) and the EGARCH volatility specification significantly affect the VaR forecast performance for stock indices in the emerging market as compared with the developed market. Moreover, the VaR forecast performance of all models with GT is superior to that with normal return distribution only for stock indices in the developed market and only for 99% level. Turning to the whole market, the VaR forecast performance is almost the same as that for the emerging market. Finally, the MHS-EGARCH model with GT distribution is the optimal model to forecast the VaR among these eight models, irrespective of which of the three markets are used. This finding can provide the financial institutions to select an appropriate model to forecast and further control the market risk they faced. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","The motivation for this paper is to investigate the use of a promising class of neural network models, Psi Sigma (PSI), when applied to the task of forecasting the one-day ahead value at risk (VaR) of the oil Brent and gold bullion series using open–high–low–close data. In order to benchmark our results, we also consider VaR forecasts from two different neural network designs, the multilayer perceptron and the recurrent neural network, a genetic programming algorithm, an extreme value theory model along with some traditional techniques such as an ARMA-Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle (1,1) model and the RiskMetrics volatility. The forecasting performance of all models for computing the VaR of the Brent oil and the gold bullion is examined over the period September 2001–August 2010 using the last year and half of data for out-of-sample testing. The evaluation of our models is done by using a series of backtesting algorithms such as the Christoffersen tests, the violation ratio and our proposed loss function that considers not only the number of violations but also their magnitude. Our results show that the PSI outperforms all other models in forecasting the VaR of gold and oil at both the 5% and 1% confidence levels, providing an accurate number of independent violations with small magnitude. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Volatility clustering is a well-known stylized feature of financial asset returns. This paper investigates asymmetric pattern in volatility clustering by employing a univariate copula approach of Chen and Fan (2006). Using daily realized kernel volatilities constructed from high frequency data from stock and foreign exchange markets, we find evidence that volatility clustering is highly nonlinear and strongly asymmetric in that clusters of high volatility occur more often than clusters of low volatility. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to address and uncover this phenomenon. In particular, the asymmetry in volatility clustering is found to be more pronounced in the stock markets than in the foreign exchange markets. Further, the volatility clusters are shown to remain persistent for over a month and asymmetric across different time periods. Our findings have important implications for risk management. A simulation study indicates that models which accommodate asymmetric volatility clustering can significantly improve the out-of-sample forecasts of Value-at-Risk. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","We studied systemic risk in European sovereign debt markets before and after the onset of the Greek debt crisis, taking the conditional value-at-risk (CoVaR) as a systemic risk measure, characterized and computed using copulas. We found that, before the debt crisis, sovereign debt markets were all coupled and systemic risk was similar for all countries. However, with the onset of the Greek crisis, debt markets decoupled and the systemic risk of the countries in crisis (excepting Spain) for the European debt market as a whole decreased, whereas that of the non-crisis countries increased to a small degree. The systemic risk of the Greek debt market for other countries in difficulties increased, especially for Portugal where systemic risk tripled after the onset of the crisis, whereas the systemic impact on the non-crisis countries decreased. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","In this study, the mean–variance framework is employed to analyze the impact of the Basel value-at-risk (VaR) market risk regulation on the institution's optimal investment policy, the stockholders’ welfare, as well as the tendency of the institution to change the risk profile of the held portfolio. It is shown that with the VaR regulation, the institution faces a new regulated capital market line, which induces resource allocation distortion in the economy. Surprisingly, only when a riskless asset is available does VaR regulation induce the institution to reduce risk. Otherwise, the regulation may induce higher risk, accompanied by asset allocation distortion. On the positive side, the regulation implies an upper bound on the risk the institution takes and it never induces the firm to select an inefficient portfolio. Moreover, when the riskless asset is available, tightening the regulation always increases the amount of maintained eligible capital and decreases risk. © 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Forecasting volatility is fundamental to forecasting parametric models of value-at-risk. The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) volatility model is the recommended model for forecasting volatility by the Riskmetrics group. For monthly data, the lambda parameter of the EWMA model is recommended to be set to 0.97. In this study, we empirically investigate if this is the optimal value of lambda in terms of forecasting volatility. Employing monthly realized volatility as the benchmark for testing the value of lambda, it is found that a value of lambda of 0.97 is far from optimal. The tests are robust to a variety of test statistics. It is further found that the optimal value of lambda is time varying and should be based upon recent historical data.

Comparing a bubble economy and a non-bubble economy, it is shown that asset price bubbles may cause a firm’s traditional risk measures such as VaR and CVaR to decline. This decline is due to a reduced standard deviation and an increased right skew of the firm value’s distribution due to bubble expansion. This effect on a firm value’s moments due to the presence of price bubbles documents that traditional risk measures do not adequately capture the impacts of bubble bursting.We propose a new risk measure to account for losses associated with bubble bursting, a phenomenon that must be taken into consideration for the proper determination of equity capital. This additional risk measure is the expected holding period loss. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","We treat the banking system as a traded credit portfolio and calculate systemic risk capital as the amount of capital that insures the portfolio's value against unexpected losses. Using data from the largest global financial institutions, we find evidence of extreme event dependence between banks during the recent financial crisis. Subsequently, we extend the existing Gaussian approach by proposing a model that accounts for the extreme event dependence, and we quantify the level of capital shortfall when this characteristic is ignored. Furthermore, the mark to market valuation approach incorporates the economic loss of credit downgrades into the estimates. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","In this paper, we employ value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) as risk measures to assess the competency of several volatility models, based on the stock indexes of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) after the financial crisis. The aim is to determine the most appropriate model for each country and identify a set of common models for the BRICS countries. A family of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models, extreme value theory (EVT) and a dynamic bivariate technique are considered to demonstrate different volatility dynamics. Some models are ruled out under the presented backtesting operations, while the nonrejected models are ranked using two loss functions. In spite of returns displaying large kurtosis, the models with normal innovation generally prove to have better estimates ofVaR and ES. GARCH and fractionally integrated GARCH are preferred by Brazil and Russia, while India favors dual models and the Student t distribution. The Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle GARCH-N is the best model for South Africa, which is the only country that rejects the stationary EVT approach. Despite these contrasting results, we find that it is possible to obtain more than one model that can be used to model all of the BRICS countries: these are the integrated GARCH-N and exponential GARCH-EVT approaches. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","Commodities constitute a nonhomogeneous asset class. Return distributions differ widely across different commodities, both in terms of tail fatness and skewness. These are features that we need to take into account when modeling risk.

To accurately backtest such models, a multiple of 200 years of historic data is necessary. Due to a lack of data, backtests are often performed using a rolling horizon. We investigate the effect of using this rolling horizon. We show that this leads to a significant increase in the probability of finding an extreme event. Not correcting for this effect can lead to false rejections ofVaR models. We illustrate this by analyzing the review of the equity stress parameter for Dutch pension funds. The review report states that the number of historic violations is too high and, therefore, the stress parameter is too low. We find that the number of historic violations can be explained by the use of a rolling window. We propose a step-by-step approach to backtest correctly using a rolling window. To our knowledge, this is the first time the effect of this commonly made error has been quantified. For realistic parameter values, the probability of finding an extreme event can increase by a factor of 7. Therefore, this effect is relevant and should be considered when evaluating VaR models. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","This paper examines whether the comparison of value-at-risk (VaR) models depends on the loss function used for such a purpose.We showa detailed comparison for several VaR models for two groups of loss functions: designed for regulators/supervisors and for risk managers/firms. Additionally, we propose a firm's loss function (FLF) that exactly measures the opportunity capital cost of the firm when the losses are covered. We find that theVaR model that minimizes the total losses is robust to the regulator's loss function (RLF) but differs from FLF, although not in an arbitrary way. The results indicate that we must distinguish between two subgroups of FLFs: functions that proxy the opportunity cost of the firm when losses are covered, and functions that penalize in the same way when losses are covered or noncovered. The best VaR model is robust to these subgroups. In any case, what is clear is that the best VaR model depends on the family of functions used: RLFs and/or FLFs, as these families provide different results. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","The accurate evaluation of a risk measure employed by a financial institution is of high importance in view of that institution's minimum capital requirement. Having a sensitive reaction to breaks in the volatility of the profit-and-loss process is a desirable property of the underlying measure. This paper proposes a loss function-based framework for the comparative measurement of the sensitivity of quantile downside risk measures to breaks in volatility or distribution. We do this by extending the model comparison approach introduced by Lopez in 1998.Value-at-risk and expected shortfall (ES) are contrasted over realistic evaluation horizons within a broad simulation study, in which numerous settings involving volatility breaks of different intensities and several data-generating processes are checked by employing a magnitude-type loss function. As a result, it can generally be noted that ES appears to be the superior measure in terms of its ability to identify breaks in the volatility. In addition, an empirical study, in which data from six stock market indexes are used, demonstrates the applicability of this procedure and reconfirms the findings from the simulation study. © 2015 Incisive Risk Information (IP) Limited.","We estimate the dynamic daily dependence between assets by applying the Semiparametric Copula-Based Multivariate Dynamic (SCOMDY) model on intraday data. Using tick data of three stock returns of the period before and during the credit crisis, we find that our dependence estimator better captures the steep increase in dependence during the onset of the crisis as compared to other commonly used time-varying copula methods. Like other high-frequency estimators, we find that the dependence estimator exhibits long memory and forecast it using a HAR model. We show that for out-of-sample forecasts, our dependence estimator performs better than the constant estimator and other commonly used time-varying copula dependence estimators. © 2015 by De Gruyter.","In this paper we introduce a triple-threshold leverage stochastic volatility (TTLSV) model for financial return time series. The main feature of the model is to allow asymmetries in the leverage effect as well as mean and volatility. In the model the asymmetric effect is modeled by a threshold nonlinear structure that the two regimes are determined by the sign of the past returns. The model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) method based on the efficient importance sampling (EIS) technique. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to examine the accuracy and finite sample properties of the proposed methodology. The EIS-based ML (EIS-ML) method shows good performance according to the Monte Carlo results. The proposed model and methodology are applied to two stock market indices for China. Strong evidence of the mean and volatility asymmetries is detected in Chinese stock market. Moreover, asymmetries in the volatility persistence and leverage effect are also discovered. The log-likelihood and Akaike information criterion (AIC) suggest evidence in favor of the proposed model. In addition, model diagnostics suggest that the proposed model performs relatively well in capturing the key features of the data. Finally, we compare models in a Value at Risk (VaR) study. The results show that the proposed model can yield more accurate VaR estimates than the alternatives. © 2015 by De Gruyter.","This article proposes a threshold stochastic volatility model that generates volatility forecasts specifically designed for value at risk (VaR) estimation. The method incorporates extreme downside shocks by modelling left-tail returns separately from other returns. Left-tail returns are generated with a t-distributional process based on the historically observed conditional excess kurtosis. This specification allows VaR estimates to be generated with extreme downside impacts, yet remains empirically widely applicable. This article applies the model to daily returns of seven major stock indices over a 22-year period and compares its forecasts to those of several other forecasting methods. Based on back-testing outcomes and likelihood ratio tests, the new model provides reliable estimates and outperforms others. © 2015 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Recent market events have reinvigorated the search for realistic return models that capture greater likelihoods of extreme movements. In this paper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both fundamental and technical traders. This is based on a trade arrival model with variable size orders and a general arrival-time distribution. With simplifications we are led in the jump-free case to a local volatility model defined by a hybrid SDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric or CIR Brownian motions, whose solution in the geometric case is given by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against another, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the hybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered by Nagahara, which is a type of ‘Pearson diffusion’, or, equivalently, a hyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on the balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally at an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type~IV form. Under less-restrictive assumptions, richer dynamics are possible, including time-dependent Johnson-SU distributions and bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is identified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a priori been expected, so that ‘25σ’ events are significantly more probable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker–Planck equation that shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian facade. These are elementary members of an extended class of distributions with a rich and varied structure, capable of describing a wide range of market behaviors. Several approaches to the density function are possible, and an example of the computation of a hyperbolic VaR is given. The model also suggests generalizations of the Bougerol identity. We touch briefly on the extent to which such a model is consistent with the dynamics of a ‘flash-crash’ event, and briefly explore the statistical evidence for our model. © 2012 Taylor &amp; Francis.","We present a technique for selecting multidimensional shock scenarios for use in financial stress testing. The methodology systematically enforces internal consistency among the shock dimensions by sampling points of arbitrary severity from a plausible joint probability distribution. The approach involves a grid search of sparse, well distributed, stress-test scenarios, which we regard as a middle ground between traditional stress testing and reverse stress testing. Choosing scenarios in this way reduces the danger of ‘blind spots’ in stress testing. We suggest extensions to address the issues of non-monotonic loss functions and univariate shocks. We provide tested and commented source code in Matlab®.","This paper introduces the concept of risk parameter in conditional volatility models of the form t=σt(θ0)ηt and develops statistical procedures to estimate this parameter. For a given risk measure r, the risk parameter is expressed as a function of the volatility coefficients θ0 and the risk, r(ηt), of the innovation process. A two-step method is proposed to successively estimate these quantities. An alternative one-step approach, relying on a reparameterization of the model and the use of a non Gaussian QML, is proposed. Asymptotic results are established for smooth risk measures, as well as for the Value-at-Risk (VaR). Asymptotic comparisons of the two approaches for VaR estimation suggest a superiority of the one-step method when the innovations are heavy-tailed. For standard GARCH models, the comparison only depends on characteristics of the innovations distribution, not on the volatility parameters. Monte-Carlo experiments and an empirical study illustrate the superiority of the one-step approach for financial series. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of using the static square root of time method, we use a dynamic approach based on volatility forecasting by non-linear models. We explore the possibility of improving the estimations using different models and distributions. By comparing the estimations of two risk measures, value at risk and expected shortfall, with different models and innovations at short-, median- and long-term horizon, we find that the best model varies with the forecasting horizon and that the generalized Pareto distribution gives the most conservative estimations with all the models at all the horizons. The empirical results show that the square root method underestimates risk at long horizons and our approach is more competitive for risk estimation over a long term. © 2013, Taylor &amp; Francis.","When correlations between assets turn positive, multi-asset portfolios can become riskier than single assets. This article presents the estimation of tail risk at very high quantiles using a semiparametric estimator which is particularly suitable for portfolios with a large number of assets. The estimator captures simultaneously the information contained in each individual asset return that composes the portfolio, and the interrelation between assets. Noticeably, the accuracy of the estimates does not deteriorate when the number of assets in the portfolio increases. The implementation is as easy for a large number of assets as it is for a small number. We estimate the probability distribution of large losses for the American stock market considering portfolios with ten, fifty and one hundred assets of stocks with different market capitalization. In either case, the approximation for the portfolio tail risk is very accurate. We compare our results with well known benchmark models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","We modify a two-step approach by McNeil and Frey (2000) for forecasting Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our approach combines the asymmetric GARCH (GJR) model that allows the high-order moments (i.e., skewness and kurtosis) of the skewed generalized t (SGT) distribution to rely on the past information set to estimate volatility, and the modified Hill estimator (Huisman et al., 2001) for estimating the innovation distribution tail of the GJR model. Using back-testing of the daily return series of 10 stock markets, the empirical results show that our proposed approach could give better one-day VaR forecasts than McNeil and Frey (2000) and the GJR/GARCH models with alternative distributions. In addition, our proposed approach also provides the accuracy of expected shortfall estimates. The evidence demonstrates that our proposed two-step approach that incorporates the modified Hill estimator into the GJR model based on the SGT density with autoregressive conditional skewness and kurtosis provides consistently accurate VaR forecasts in the short and longer sample periods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 crisis, banks claiming positive diversification benefits are being met with skepticism. Nevertheless, diversification might be important and sizable for some large internationally active banking groups. We use a universally applicable correlation matrix approach to calculate international diversification effects, in which bank subsidiaries are treated as individual assets of the banking group portfolio. We apply the framework to 49 of the world's largest banking groups with significant foreign business units over the 1992-2009 period. Focusing on the most important risk in banking, credit risk, we find that allowing for geographical diversification could reduce banks' credit risk by 1.1% on average, with risk reduction ranging from negligible up to 8%. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","This article develops a nonparametric varying-coefficient approach for modeling the expectile-based value at risk (EVaR). EVaR has an advantage over the conventional quantile-based VaR (QVaR) of being more sensitive to the magnitude of extreme losses. EVaR can also be used for calculating QVaR and expected shortfall (ES) by exploiting the one-to-one mapping from expectiles to quantiles, and the relationship between VaR and ES. Previous studies on conditional EVaR estimation only considered parametric autoregressive model set-ups, which account for the stochastic dynamics of asset returns but ignore other exogenous economic and investment related factors. Our approach overcomes this drawback and allows expectiles to be modeled directly using covariates that may be exogenous or lagged dependent in a flexible way. Risk factors associated with profits and losses can then be identified via the expectile regression at different levels of prudentiality. We develop a local linear smoothing technique for estimating the coefficient functions within an asymmetric least squares minimization set-up, and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resultant estimator. To save computing time, we propose to use a one-step weighted local least squares procedure to compute the estimates. Our simulation results show that the computing advantage afforded by this one-step procedure over full iteration is not compromised by a deterioration in estimation accuracy.

This involves the derivation of a Nonlinear Quadrature Filter (NQF) that operates directly on the nonlinear ASV model. The NQF filter makes Gaussian approximations to the prior and posterior density of the latent volatility, but not in the observation space which makes possible easy handling of heavy-tailed data. Experiments in Value-at-Risk (VaR) assessment via an original bootsrtapping methodology are conducted with NQF and several ASV learning algorithms. The results indicate that our approach yields models with better statistical characteristics than the considered competitors, and slightly improved VaR forecasts. © 2014 IEEE.","We introduce a model in which a regulator employs mechanism design to embed her human capital beta signal(s) in a firm's capital structure. This can enhance her compensation at the firm, and the value of her contract with the firm in the form of an executive stock option. We prove that the agency cost of this revolving door behavior increases the firm's financial leverage, bankruptcy risk, and affects estimation of firm value at risk (VaR). © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","This study examines the Value-at-Risk for ten euro-zone equity markets individually and also divided into two groups: PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain) and the Core (Austria, Finland, France, Germany and the Netherlands), employing four VaR estimation and evaluation methods considered over the full period and the pre- and post-global crisis subperiods 1 and 2. The backtesting results are also evaluated according to the Basel capital requirements. The results demonstrate that the CEVT methods meetall the statistical criteria the best for most individual equity indices over the full period, but these results over the two subperiods for those two methods are mixed, compared to those the DPOT methods. Moreover, the two optimal group portfolios of the PIIGS and the Core as well as the grand portfolio that combines the ten indices do not show much diversification benefits. The PIIGS portfolio selects Spain's IBEX only, while that of the Core opts for Austria's ATX only in the full period and subperiod 1. However, Germany's DAX overwhelmingly dominates both the Core and the Grand portfolios in subperiod 2. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","We analyze the impact of the estimation frequency-updating parameter estimates on a daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly basis-for commonly used GARCH models in a large-scale study, using more than twelve years (2000-2012) of daily returns for constituents of the S&amp;P 500 index. We assess the implication for one-day ahead 95% and 99% Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts with the test for correct conditional coverage of Christoffersen (1998) and for Expected Shortfall (ES) forecasts with the block-bootstrap test of ES violations of Jalal and Rockinger (2008). Using the false discovery rate methodology of Storey (2002) to estimate the percentage of stocks for which the model yields correct VaR and ES forecasts, we conclude that there is no difference in performance between updating the parameter estimates of the GARCH equation at a daily or weekly frequency, whereas monthly or even quarterly updates are only marginally outperformed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","The maturity effect (ME) of futures prices postulated by Samuelson (1965) is re-examined using three nonparametric tests. The consistent entropy asymmetry test by Racine and Maasoumi (2007) indicates that variance is an appropriate risk or uncertainty measure for ME, and value-at-risk and expected shortfall are also adopted. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov dominance test and Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank test are employed to rank the estimates of the three risk measures under a moving-window framework. The testing outcomes are contingent on futures type, testing method and risk measures.

This paper applies extreme value methods to investigate the limiting distribution of the extreme returns of the NIKKEI225, FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 indices as well as the indices of some of largest sectors in Japan, UK and US. The results indicate that the much celebrated Generalised Extreme Value distribution does not provide the most accurate description of the minima since the Generalised Logistic distribution performs better due to its ability to better capture the fat tails of returns. The time varying nature of extremes is also confirmed while a simulation exercise adds to the robustness of our results. It is also shown that the findings may have important implications for risk models, such as VaR and Expected Shortfall, since risk measures which cannot capture the fatness of tails of the empirical distribution function of returns may lead to serious underestimation of downside risk. © 2013 .","This work is concerned with the statistical modeling of the dependence structure between three energy commodity markets (WTI crude oil, natural gas and heating oil) using the concept of copulas and proposes a method for estimating the Value at risk (VaR) of energy portfolio based on the combination of time series models with models of the extreme value theory before fitting a copula. Each return series is modeled by AR-(FI) GARCH univariate model. Then, we fit the GPD distribution to the tails of the residuals to model marginal residuals distributions. The extreme value copula to the iid residuals is fitted and we simulate from it to construct N portfolios and estimate VaR. As a first step, the method is applied to a two-dimensional energy portfolio. In second step, we extend method in trivariate context to measure VaR of three-dimensional energy portfolio. Dependences between residuals are modeled using a trivariate nested Gumbel copulas. Methods proposed are compared with various univariate and multivariate conventional VaR methods. The reported results demonstrate that GARCH-t, conditional EVT and FIGARCH extreme value copula methods produce acceptable estimates of risk both for standard and more extreme VaR quantiles. Generally, copula methods are less accurate compared with their predictive performances in the case of portfolio composed of exchange market indices. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme value theory is concerned with the study of the asymptotic distribution of extreme events, that is to say events which are rare in frequency and huge in magnitude with respect to the majority of observations. Statistical methods derived from it have been employed increasingly in finance, especially for risk measurement.

Furthermore, we introduce fractional-step lattices to help reduce interpolation error in the extrapolation algorithms. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these algorithms with numerical results. A key finding is that combining the techniques of tilting lattice, extrapolation, and fractional steps substantially increases speed and accuracy.","This paper proposes a two-regime threshold model for the conditional distribution of stock returns in which returns follow a distinct skewed Student t distribution within each regime: the model allows capturing time variation in the conditional distribution of returns, as well as higher order moments. An application of the model to daily U.S. stock returns illustrates the advantages of the proposed model in comparison to alternative specifications: the model performs well in terms of in-sample fit; it more accurately estimates the conditional volatility; and it produces useful risk assessment as measured by the term structure of value at risk. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","We propose a new set of formal backtests for VaR-forecasts that significantly improve upon existing backtesting procedures.

Second, we stress the importance of testing the property of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) VaR-exceedances and propose a simple approach that explicitly tests for the presence of clusters in VaR-violation processes. Results from a simulation study indicate that our tests significantly outperform competing backtests in several distinct settings. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Values of tranche spreads of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are driven by the joint default performance of the assets in the collateral pool. The dependence between the entities in the portfolio mainly depends on current economic conditions. Therefore, a correlation implied from tranches can be seen as a measure of the general situation of the credit market. We analyse the European market of standardized CDOs using tranches of the iTraxx index in the periods before and during the global financial crisis. We investigate the evolution of the correlations using different copula models: the standard Gaussian, the NIG, the double-t, and the Gumbel copula model. After calibration of these models, one obtains a time varying vector of parameters. We analyse the dynamic pattern of these coefficients. That enables us to forecast future parameters and consequently calculate Value-at-Risk measures for iTraxx Europe tranches. © 2014 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","This paper proposes a new methodology to compute Value at Risk (VaR) for quantifying losses in credit portfolios. We approximate the cumulative distribution of the loss function by a finite combination of Haar wavelet basis functions and calculate the coefficients of the approximation by inverting its Laplace transform. The Wavelet Approximation (WA) method is particularly suitable for non-smooth distributions, often arising in small or concentrated portfolios, when the hypothesis of the Basel II formulas are violated. To test the methodology we consider the Vasicek one-factor portfolio credit loss model as our model framework. WA is an accurate, robust and fast method, allowing the estimation of the VaR much more quickly than with a Monte Carlo (MC) method at the same level of accuracy and reliability. © 2014 Copyright Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","This paper investigates stock-bond portfolios' tail risks such as value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES), and the way in which these measures have been affected by the global financial crisis. The semiparametric t-copulas adequately model stock-bond returns joint distributions of G7 countries and Australia. Empirical results show that the (negative) weak stock-bond returns dependence has increased significantly for seven countries after the crisis, except for Italy. However, both VaR and ES have increased for all eight countries. Before the crisis, the minimum portfolio VaR and ES were achieved at an interior solution only for the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and Italy. After the crisis, the corner solution was found for all eight countries. Evidence of \"flight to quality\" and \"safety first\" investor behaviour was strong, after the global financial crisis. The semiparametric t-copula adequately forecasts the outer-sample VaR. These findings have implications for global financial regulators and the Basel Committee, whose central focus is currently on increasing the capital requirements as a consequence of the recent global financial crisis. © 2014.","We analyze a sample of 64 oil and gas companies of the nonrenewable energy sector from 24 countries using daily observations on return on stock from July 15, 2003 to August 14, 2012.We show that specific and common risk factors are priced. Specific risk factors including company size and leverage are important in explaining returns of energy companies and those companies became more exposed to credit concerns after the financial crisis of 2008. Common risk factors including the U.S. Dow Jones market excess return, the VIX, the WTI price of crude oil, and the FX of the Euro, Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, Japanese yen and British pound vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar are also important in explaining energy company returns.

We first estimate the latent volatility process using the information of intermediate quantiles. We then apply EVT to the tail observations to obtain a sound estimate of the likelihood of experiencing an extreme event. Quantile autoregression and EVT together improve efficiency in estimation of extreme quantiles, by borrowing information from neighbor quantiles. Monte Carlo simulation indicates that, the proposed method is promising to provide more accurate estimates for VaR of a financial portfolio, where non-Gaussian tail is present. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","The higher moments of a distribution often lead to estimated value-at-risk (VaR) biases. This study's objective is to examine the backtesting of VaR models that consider the higher moments of the distribution for minimum-variance hedging portfolios (MVHPs) of the stock indices and futures in the Greater China Region for both short and long hedgers. The results reveal that the best backtesting VaR for the MVHP considered both the higher moments of the MVHP distribution and the asymmetry in volatility, cross-market asymmetry in volatility, and level effects in the covariance matrix of assets in the MVHP.

The extreme downside risk of a market is measured as the occurrence of extreme downside movement-market returns falling below left-tail Value at Risk in a Markov switching framework. The empirical findings are consistent with the following notions. First, extreme downside movements of the S&amp;P 500 and Nikkei 225 are significantly predictive for the likelihood of extreme downside movements in all the investigated Asia-Pacific markets. Second, the majority of Asia-Pacific markets become more sensitive to Japan's extreme downside risk when the Japanese market switches into high volatility periods, whereas the U.S. spillover effect is intensified only on Taiwan during high volatility periods in the U.S. Third, mainland China is the least sensitive to extreme downside risk in the U.S. and Japan, Australia is the most sensitive to the U.S., and Singapore is the most sensitive to Japan. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","We propose a generalization of the classical notion of the V at Rλ that takes into account not only the probability of the losses, but the balance between such probability and the amount of the loss. This is obtained by defining a new class of law invariant risk measures based on an appropriate family of acceptance sets. The V at Rλ and other known law invariant risk measures turn out to be special cases of our proposal.

This empirical work is developed in a hybrid credit risk framework that incorporates recovery rate risk. Dependence structures among firms and between external shocks affecting firms together are considered. The presence of correlations among firm leverage ratios and the interrelation between default probabilities and recovery rates produces clusters of defaults with low recovery rates. This has a major impact on standard risk measures such as Value-at-Risk and conditional tail expectation. Consequently, an appropriate measurement of the contagion has a tremendous effect on the capital requirement of many financial institutions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","We provide a rigorous proof of granularity adjustment (GA) formulas to evaluate loss distributions and risk measures (value-at-risk) in the case of heterogenous portfolios, multiple systematic factors and random recoveries. As a significant improvement with respect to the literature, we detail all the technical conditions of validity and provide an upper bound of the remainder term for finite portfolio sizes. Moreover, we deal explicitly with the case of general loss distributions, possibly with masses. For some simple portfolio models, we prove empirically that the granularity adjustments do not always improve the infinitely granular first-order approximations. This stresses the importance of checking some conditions of regularity before relying on such techniques. Smoothing the underlying loss distributions through random recoveries or exposures improves the GA performances in general. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Time series of financial asset values exhibit well-known statistical features such as heavy tails and volatility clustering. We propose a nonparametric extension of the classical Peaks-Over-Threshold method from extreme value theory to fit the time varying volatility in situations where the stationarity assumption may be violated by erratic changes of regime, say. As a result, we provide a method for estimating conditional risk measures applicable to both stationary and nonstationary series.

A key reason for this is that risk measures are subject to a model risk due, e.g. to specification and estimation uncertainty. While regulators have proposed that financial institutions assess the model risk, there is no accepted approach for computing such a risk. We propose a remedy for this by a general framework for the computation of risk measures robust to model risk by empirically adjusting the imperfect risk forecasts by outcomes from backtesting frameworks, considering the desirable quality of VaR models such as the frequency, independence and magnitude of violations. We also provide a fair comparison between the main risk models using the same metric that corresponds to model risk required corrections. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Recent research has found a number of scaling law relationships in foreign exchange data. These relationships, estimated using simple ordinary least squares, can be used to forecast losses in foreign exchange time series from as little as one month's tick data.

Compared to these models, the new scaling law is easier to fit, provides more stable forecasts and is very accurate. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor &amp; Francis.","This study proposes a novel framework for the joint modelling of commodity forward curves. Its key contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a family of dynamic conditional correlation models based on hierarchical Archimedean copulae (HAC-DCC), which are flexible but parsimonious instruments that capture a wide range of dynamic dependencies. Second, we apply these models in the context of commodity forward curves as part of the framework. An extensive Value-at-Risk analysis shows that certain HAC-DCC models consistently outperform other introduced benchmarks in terms of the preciseness of their out-of-sample distribution forecasts of the returns of various commodity futures portfolios. This shows that the proposed modelling framework, as one of its possible applications, can be a useful and convenient risk management tool. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","This paper is concerned with linear portfolio value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) computation when the portfolio risk factors are leptokurtic, imprecise and/or vague. Following Yoshida (2009), the risk factors are modeled as fuzzy random variables in order to handle both their random variability and their vagueness. We discuss and extend the Yoshida model to some non-Gaussian distributions and provide associated ES. Secondly, assuming that the risk factors' degree of imprecision changes over time, original fuzzy portfolio VaR and ES models are introduced. For a given subjectivity level fixed by the investor, these models allow the computation of a pessimistic and an optimistic estimation of the value-at-risk and of the expected shortfall. Finally, some empirical examples carried out on three portfolios constituted by some chosen French stocks, show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","This study utilizes four types of model, which are composed of two volatility specifications (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity--GARCH--and autoregressive jump intensity--ARJI) and two value-at-risk (VaR) approaches (parametric and semi-parametric) with three return distribution settings (normal, GED and SGED), to explore, under the same return distribution settings and GARCH-based models as the benchmark, which variance specification and which VaR approach can enhance the VaR performance of GARCH-based models through assessments of accuracy, and further investigate approaches to mitigating the impact of inappropriate distributional settings that may cause misestimation of the parametric approach to VaR via a range of statistics. Empirical results show that, with regard to a long position, especially for the filter historical simulation (FHS) approach, both the variance specification of the ARJI approach and the FHS VaR approach can not only improve the VaR forecasting performance of GARCH-based models but also significantly reduce the influence of inappropriate return distribution settings on the VaR estimate of GARCH-based models. Moreover, FHS-ARJI-based models seem to be superior to FHS-GARCH-based models, but less significantly so than for the other groups competing above. As to short positions, both ARJI-based models and GARCH-based models seem to have similar VaR performance whereas FHS-GARCH-based models are superior to both GARCH-based models and ARJI-based models. In addition, the other three types of model (ARJI, FHS-GARCH and FHS-ARJI) can reduce more effectively the impact of incorrect return distribution specifications of GARCH-based models as compared with the case of a long position. Finally, within the same type of model, the SGED has just about the best performance among these three distribution specifications for a long position, whereas these phenomena seem to be less significant for a short position. Additionally, the VaR forecasting performance of a short position is less significantly affected by return distribution specifications, volatility specifications or VaR approaches as compared with that of a long position. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","This study proposes a new approach for estimating value-at-risk (VaR). This approach combines quasi-maximum-likelihood fitting of asymmetric conditional autoregressive range (ACARR) models to estimate the current volatility and classical extreme value theory (EVT) to estimate the tail of the innovation distribution of the ACARR model. The proposed approach reflects two well-known phenomena found in most financial time series: stochastic volatility and the fat-tailedness of conditional distributions. This approach presents two main advantages over the McNeil and Frey approach. First, the ACARR model in this approach is an asymmetric model that treats the upward and downward movements of the asset price asymmetrically, whereas the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model in the McNeil and Frey approach is a symmetric model that ignores the asymmetric structure of the asset price. Second, the proposed method uses classical EVT to estimate the tail of the distribution of the residuals to avoid the threshold issue in the modern EVT model. Since the McNeil and Frey approach uses modern EVT, it may estimate the tail of the innovation distribution poorly. Back testing of historical time series data shows that our approach gives better VaR estimates than the McNeil and Frey approach. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Empirical evidence suggests that asset returns correlate more strongly in bear markets than conventional correlation estimates imply. We propose a method for determining complete tail-correlation matrices based on Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimates.

Our empirical investigation is based on the wavelet squared coherence which allows us to assess the co-movement in both time-frequency spaces. Our results reveal frequent changes in the pattern of the co-movements especially after 2007 for all the selected GCC markets at relatively higher frequencies. We further note an increasing strength of dependence among the GCC stock markets during the last financial crisis signifying enhanced portfolio benefits for investors in the short term relative to the long term. On the financial side, we uncover that the strength of co-movement between GCC markets may impact the multi-country portfolio's value at risk (VaR) levels. These findings provide potential implications for portfolio managers operating in the GCC region who are invited to consider co-movement through both frequencies and time when designing their portfolios. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","A Bayesian analysis of the stochastic volatility model with regime-switching skewness in heavy-tailed errors is proposed using a generalized hyperbolic (GH) skew Student's t-distribution.

Empirical results show that interpretable regime-switching skewness can improve model fit and Value-at-Risk performance in a comparison against several other SV models with constant skewness or jump diffusions. © 2013 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.","This paper aims to determine if during the recent European financial crisis European markets are efficient in the weak form, as well to introduce an approach to properly predict daily risk of portfolios composed by these market assets, considering their dependence structure.

For portfolios with stocks of different sizes we obtain better VaR estimates when taking market capitalization into account. We also find that it is important to consider crisis and non-crisis periods separately when estimating VaR across different sizes.

But when the forecast horizon is greater than the frequency of the GARCH model, such predictions have typically required time-consuming simulations of the aggregated returns distributions. This paper shows that fast, quasi-analytic GARCH VaR calculations can be based on new formulae for the first four moments of aggregated GARCH returns. Our extensive empirical study compares the Cornish-Fisher expansion with the Johnson SU distribution for fitting distributions to analytic moments of normal and Student t, symmetric and asymmetric (GJR) GARCH processes to returns data on different financial assets, for the purpose of deriving accurate GARCH VaR forecasts over multiple horizons and significance levels. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","This paper introduces an alternative method for assessing the quality of risk management models. Specifically, using the forecast efficiency notion that forecast errors should be independent of a pertinent information set, we consider the extent to which unanticipated downside risk (extreme risk) is independent of overseas extreme risk. This is achieved using a bootstrap version of the non-causality test recently introduced by Hong et al., data covering 45 international equity markets, and by measuring extreme risk via a class of risk management models recently introduced by Xiao and Koenker. In doing this, we find significant evidence of transmission (causality) across national borders. Moreover, we discuss how risk managers in developed and emerging markets can parsimoniously incorporate such information (international dependency) into their risk management models to produce measures of downside risk that have more desirable ex post properties (viz. forecast efficiency properties). © 2011 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.","The aim of this paper is to forecast (out-of-sample) the distribution of financial returns based on realized volatility measures constructed from high-frequency returns.

The results suggest that the model outperforms an asymmetric GARCH specification when applied to the S&amp;P 500 futures returns, in particular on the right tail of the distribution.

A decline in the fundamental risk of assets ameliorates funding conditions, boosting the banks' ability to expand their balance sheets. In principle, a higher continuation value would improve incentives to put effort. However, the rise in asset demand and prices also increases the payoff in liquidation, eventually reducing the equilibrium optimal effort. Poor incentives impose socially inefficient liquidation and can be corrected through a regulatory capital requirement. We show that the requirement should be high when fundamental risk is low. Therefore, the model suggests a theoretical foundation for macroprudential regulation and the countercyclical capital buffer of Basel III. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","A Monte Carlo (MC) experiment is conducted to study the forecasting performance of a variety of volatility models under alternative data-generating processes (DGPs). The models included in the MC study are the (Fractionally Integrated) Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models ((FI)GARCH), the Stochastic Volatility model (SV), the Long Memory Stochastic Volatility model (LMSV) and the Markov-switching Multifractal model (MSM). The MC study enables us to compare the relative forecasting performance of the models accounting for different characterizations of the latent volatility process: specifications that incorporate short/long memory, autoregressive components, stochastic shocks, Markov-switching and multifractality. Forecasts are evaluated by means of mean squared errors (MSE), mean absolute errors (MAE) and value-at-risk (VaR) diagnostics. Furthermore, complementarities between models are explored via forecast combinations. The results show that (i) the MSM model best forecasts volatility under any other alternative characterization of the latent volatility process and (ii) forecast combinations provide systematic improvements upon most single misspecified models, but are typically inferior to the MSM model even if the latter is applied to data governed by other processes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","The analysis of extremes in financial return series is often based on the assumption of independent and identically distributed observations. However, stylized facts such as clustered extremes and serial dependence typically violate the assumption of independence. This has been the main motivation to propose an approach that is able to overcome these difficulties by considering the time between extreme events as a stochastic process. One of the advantages of the method consists in its capability to capture the short-term behavior of extremes without involving an arbitrary stochastic volatility model or a prefiltration of the data, which would certainly affect the estimate. We make use of the proposed model to obtain an improved estimate for the value at risk (VaR). The model is then compared to various competing approaches such as Engle and Marianelli's CAViaR and the GARCH-EVT model.

We define the systemic risk contribution of an institution as the change from its CoVaR in its benchmark state (defined as a one-standard deviation event) to its CoVaR under financial distress. We estimate the systemic risk contributions of four financial industry groups consisting of a large number of institutions for the sample period June 2000 to February 2008 and the 12. months prior to the beginning of the crisis.

We obtain analytical results for various risk measures including the Value at Risk equation; this includes deriving a new analytical result for the quantile function of the half-normal distributions (which will be of interest to Statisticians in general).

We make use of the proposed model in order to obtain an improved estimate for the Value at Risk in oil markets. Empirical findings suggest that the reliability and stability of Value at Risk estimates improve as a result of finer modeling approach. This is supported by an empirical application in the representative West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oil markets. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","As the skewed return distribution is a prominent feature in nonlinear portfolio selection problems which involve derivative assets with nonlinear payoff structures, Value-at-Risk (VaR) is particularly suitable to serve as a risk measure in nonlinear portfolio selection. Unfortunately, the nonlinear portfolio selection formulation using VaR risk measure is in general a computationally intractable optimization problem. We investigate in this paper nonlinear portfolio selection models using approximate parametric Value-at-Risk. More specifically, we use first-order and second-order approximations of VaR for constructing portfolio selection models, and show that the portfolio selection models based on Delta-only, Delta-Gamma-normal and worst-case Delta-Gamma VaR approximations can be reformulated as second-order cone programs, which are polynomially solvable using interior-point methods. Our simulation and empirical results suggest that the model using Delta-Gamma-normal VaR approximation performs the best in terms of a balance between approximation accuracy and computational efficiency. © 2013.","Basel III represents a crucial step in strengthening the capital rules underlying banking operations, aimed at reducing the probability and severity of a systemic crisis. Alongside two supplementary capital buffers, the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision imposed severe pressure on the Value-at-Risk based Internal Models Approach in order to increase. This is to increase the capital base by adding the stressed Value-at-Risk component in an effort to reduce reliance on internal models while keeping the Standardized Approach avenue open. However, even though those measures might appear theoretically correct, evidence gathered for long and short exposures in Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain highlights several defects in Basel III. We emphasize that leptokurtic models, primarily those derived from Extreme Value Theory, should be enforced in the regulations given their superior performance in market crises, and that Basel II could have shielded against 2008 mayhem provided that heavy-tailed techniques had been employed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","In this paper we propose a unified framework to analyse contemporaneous and temporal aggregation of a widely employed class of integrated moving average (IMA) models. We obtain a closed-form representation for the parameters of the contemporaneously and temporally aggregated process as a function of the parameters of the original one. These results are useful due to the close analogy between the integrated GARCH (1,. 1) model for conditional volatility and the IMA (1,. 1) model for squared returns, which share the same autocorrelation function. In this framework, we present an application dealing with Value-at-Risk (VaR) prediction at different sampling frequencies for an equally weighted portfolio composed of multiple indices. We apply the aggregation results by inferring the aggregate parameter in the portfolio volatility equation from the estimated vector IMA (1,. 1) model of squared returns. Empirical results show that VaR predictions delivered using this suggested approach are at least as accurate as those obtained by applying standard univariate methodologies, such as RiskMetrics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","In the fast changing financial circumstances of nowadays, in avoiding the crisis of closing down, financial institutions are concerned about the efficiency and risk strictly in the meantime. Therefore, efficiency and risk management are goals for a financial institution administrator. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a non-parameter approach to evaluate the performance of DMU's efficiency and the variables used in the DEA are all accurate values. However, when the input or output variables are fuzzy, the performance of DMUs must proceed by the Fuzzy-DEA. On the basis of risk uncertainty, this research plans to apply the expanding model of Fuzzy Slack-Based Measurement (Fuzzy SBM). The efficiency scores estimated by Fuzzy SBM model are subordinate to functional form, which provides efficiency value region in different degrees of confidence, conforms to the characteristic of risk anticipation, and estimates the management achievement of Taiwan banking under market risk. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","This paper examines the dependence structure between European Union allowances (EUAs) and crude oil markets during the second commitment period of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and the implications for portfolio management. Using different copula models, our findings suggest positive average dependence and extreme symmetric independence that is consistent with interdependence and no contagion effects between the EUA and crude oil markets. The implication of this result for EUA-oil portfolios points to the existence of diversification benefits, hedging effectiveness, and value-at-risk reductions. The EUA market is therefore an attractive market for investors in terms of diversifying market risk and reducing downside risk in crude oil markets. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","This paper studies the economic foundations for maximum leverage ratio capital adequacy rules. The paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, we show how to determine the maximum leverage ratio such that the probability of insolvency is less than some predetermined quantity. Two, we show that a leverage ratio rule controls for the same risks as does a Value-at-Risk (VaR) capital adequacy rule. Third, we argue that leverage ratio rules are better than VaR rules because they are more intuitive and easier to compare across firms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","This paper proposes an original procedure which allows for testing of Granger-causality for multiple risk levels across tail distributions, hence extending the procedure proposed by Hong et al. (2009). Asymptotic and finite sample properties of the test are considered. This new Granger-causality framework is applied for a set of regional oil markets series. It helps to tackle two main questions 1) Whether oil markets are more or less integrated during periods of extreme energetic prices movements and 2) Whether price-setter markets change during such periods. Our findings indicate that the integration level between crude oil markets tends to decrease during extreme periods and that price-setter markets also change. Such results have policy implication and stress the importance of an active energetic policy during episode of extreme movements. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","We propose a possibilistic portfolio model with VaR constraint and risk-free investment based on the possibilistic mean and variance, while assuming that the expected rate of returns is a fuzzy number. The model shows more clearly that, in the financial market affected by several non-probabilistic factors, risk-averse investors wish not only to reach the expected rate of returns in their actual investment, but also to assure that the maximum of their possible future risk is lower than an expected loss. Under the condition that the expected rate of returns is a normal distribution fuzzy variable, we proposed a theorem as the solution, and derive a crisp equivalent form of the possibilistic portfolio under constraints of VaR and risk-free investment. This model is an expansion of the fuzzy possibilistic mean-variance model by Zhang (2007). Finally, an empirical study is carried out using the data concerning some stocks of various industries listed at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A conclusion is reached that the investors are able to choose a portfolio more suitable to them under the VaR constraint. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Portfolio risk estimation requires appropriate modeling of fat-tails and asymmetries in dependence in combination with a true downside risk measure. In this survey, we discuss computational aspects of a Monte Carlo based framework for risk estimation and risk capital allocation. We review different probabilistic approaches focusing on practical aspects of statistical estimation and scenario generation. We discuss value-at-risk and conditional value-at-risk and comment on the implications of using a fat-tailed Monte Carlo framework for the reliability of risk estimates including model risk and Monte Carlo variability.","We examine daily cross-market return interactions and downside risk between a US REIT returns index and the return indexes of twelve international REIT markets. These relationships are investigated for a period of normal REIT market conditions as well as for periods of inflating and collapsing REIT prices. We find that US REIT returns are contemporaneously correlated with other REITs most strongly during the bubble and crash market conditions where the US REIT market is an almost unilateral transmitter of returns. We also find that the Value at Risk (VaR) of the least capitalized REIT markets is proportionally higher during base/normal market conditions but that the largest REIT markets have the highest VaR contribution during the crash (financial crisis) period. Overall, our evidence indicates that REIT market risk shifted to the largest REIT markets and that diversification benefits eroded considerably during turbulent market conditions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","The present study compares the performance of the long memory FIGARCH model, with that of the short memory GARCH specification, in the forecasting of multi-period value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) across 20 stock indices worldwide. The dataset is composed of daily data covering the period from 1989 to 2009. The research addresses the question of whether or not accounting for long memory in the conditional variance specification improves the accuracy of the VaR and ES forecasts produced, particularly for longer time horizons. Accounting for fractional integration in the conditional variance model does not appear to improve the accuracy of the VaR forecasts for the 1-day-ahead, 10-day-ahead and 20-day-ahead forecasting horizons relative to the short memory GARCH specification. Additionally, the results suggest that underestimation of the true VaR figure becomes less prevalent as the forecasting horizon increases. Furthermore, the GARCH model has a lower quadratic loss between actual returns and ES forecasts, for the majority of the indices considered for the 10-day and 20-day forecasting horizons. Therefore, a long memory volatility model compared to a short memory GARCH model does not appear to improve the VaR and ES forecasting accuracy, even for longer forecasting horizons. Finally, the rolling-sampled estimated FIGARCH parameters change less smoothly over time compared to the GARCH models. Hence, the parameters' time-variant characteristic cannot be entirely due to the news information arrival process of the market; a portion must be due to the FIGARCH modelling process itself. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","The study examines applicability and performance of Value-at-Risk (VaR) models with respect to foreign exchange risk assessment within a managed float regime. Pakistani rupee offers an instructive case as it seems to manage its currency mainly against the US dollar, but to a lesser extent against the euro. We find that the distributional characteristics are quite different for the two currencies. We also find that the dynamic processes are remarkably different for the two exchange rates. The results indicate that compared with alternative competing models, the foreign exchange risk is better modeled using VaR based on Extreme Value Theory. Our findings underscore the importance of correctly specifying the return model in a dynamic framework. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","A new model class for univariate asset returns is proposed which involves the use of mixtures of stable Paretian distributions, and readily lends itself to use in a multivariate context for portfolio selection. The model nests numerous ones currently in use, and is shown to outperform all its special cases. In particular, an extensive out-of-sample risk forecasting exercise for seven major FX and equity indices confirms the superiority of the general model compared to its special cases and other competitors. Estimation issues related to problems associated with mixture models are discussed, and a new, general, method is proposed to successfully circumvent these. The model is straightforwardly extended to the multivariate setting by using an independent component analysis framework. The tractability of the relevant characteristic function then facilitates portfolio optimization using expected shortfall as the downside risk measure. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

First, we theoretically show that the VaR portfolio measure is subadditive in the relevant tail region if asset returns are multivariate regularly varying, thus allowing for dependent returns. Second, we note that VaR estimated from historical simulations may lead to violations of subadditivity. This upset of the theoretical VaR subadditivity in the tail arises because the coarseness of the empirical distribution can affect the apparent fatness of the tails. Finally, we document a dramatic reduction in the frequency of subadditivity violations, by using semi-parametric extreme value techniques for VaR estimation instead of historical simulations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Recovery rates are often treated as an afterthought; they are modelled independently, in many cases they are even assumed to be constant. This despite their pronounced effect on the tail of the loss distribution. Here, we take a step back, historically, and start again from the Merton model, where defaults and recoveries are both determined by an underlying process. Hence, they are intrinsically connected. For the diffusion process, we can derive the functional relation between expected recovery rate and default probability. This relation depends on a single parameter only. In Monte Carlo simulations we find that the same functional dependence also holds for jump-diffusion and GARCH processes. We discuss how to incorporate this structural recovery rate into reduced-form models, in order to restore essential structural information which is usually neglected in the reduced-form approach. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","The object of this paper is to produce distributional forecasts of asset price volatility and its associated risk premia using a non-linear state space approach. Option and spot market information on the latent variance process is captured by using dual 'model-free' variance measures to define a bivariate observation equation in the state space model. The premium for variance diffusive risk is defined as linear in the latent variance (in the usual fashion) whilst the premium for variance jump risk is specified as a conditionally deterministic dynamic process, driven by a function of past measurements. The inferential approach adopted is Bayesian, implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that caters for the multiple sources of non-linearity in the model and for the bivariate measure. The method is applied to spot and option price data on the S&amp;P500 index from 1999 to 2008, with conclusions drawn about investors' required compensation for variance risk during the recent financial turmoil. The accuracy of the probabilistic forecasts of the observable variance measures is demonstrated, and compared with that of forecasts yielded by alternative methods. To illustrate the benefits of the approach, it is used to produce forecasts of prices of derivatives on volatility itself. In addition, the posterior distribution is augmented by information on daily returns to produce value at risk predictions. Linking the variance risk premia to the risk aversion parameter in a representative agent model, probabilistic forecasts of (approximate) relative risk aversion are also produced. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We show that Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall constraints, when imposed dynamically, lead to similar optimal portfolios and wealth distributions. We also show that, in utility terms, the costs of imposing these constraints can be sizeable. For a 96% funded pension plan, both an annual Value-at-Risk constraint and an annual Expected Shortfall constraint can lead to an economic cost of about 2.5-3.8% of initial wealth over a 15-year horizon. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Intraday Value-at-Risk (VaR) is one of the risk measures used by market participants involved in high-frequency trading. High-frequency log-returns feature important kurtosis (fat tails) and volatility clustering (extreme log-returns appear in clusters) that VaR models should take into account. We propose a marked point process model for the excesses of the time series over a high threshold that combines Hawkes processes for the exceedances with a generalized Pareto distribution model for the marks (exceedance sizes). The conditional approach features intraday clustering of extremes and is used to calculate instantaneous conditional VaR. The models are backtested on real data and compared to a competitor approach that proposes a nonparametric extension of the classical peaks-over-threshold method. Maximum likelihood estimation is computationally intensive; we use a differential evolution genetic algorithm to find adequate starting values for the optimization process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","In the wake of the subprime crisis of 2007 which uncovered shortfalls in capital levels of most financial institutions, the Basel Committee planned to strengthen current regulations contained in Basel II. While maintaining the Internal Model Approach based on Value-at-Risk, a stressed VaR calculated over highly strung periods is to be added to present directives to constitute Minimum Capital Requirements. Consequently, the adoption of the appropriate VaR specification remains a subject of paramount importance as it determines the financial condition of the firm. In this article I explore the performance of several models to compute MCR in the context of Emerging and Frontier stock markets within the present and proposed capital structures. Considering the evidence gathered, two major contributions arise: (a) heavy-tailed distributions - particularly Extreme Value (EV) ones-, reveal as the most accurate technique to model market risks, hence preventing huge capital deficits under current measures; (b) the application of such methods could allow slight modifications to present mandate and simultaneously avoid sVaR or at least reduce its scope, thus mitigating the impact regarding the enhancement of capital base. Therefore, I suggest that the inclusion of EV in planned supervisory accords should reduce development costs and foster healthier financial structures. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","This article analyses the extreme movements of exchange rates of the seven main currencies traded in the Foreign Exchange market against the US dollar: Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen, Swiss franc, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar by using tail index indicators. Payaslioǧ lu (2009) considers the case of the Turkish exchange rate using the traditional Hill (1975) estimator as a tool. In this article, we employ also an alternative estimator proposed in Iglesias and Linton (2009) that is shown to have, in some cases, improved finite sample properties and it provides substantially different results versus the Hill estimator. We find that for the Euro, Japanese Yen, Swiss franc, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars, the Hill estimator provides a better measure to analyse the extreme behaviour; while for the British pound, the Iglesias and Linton alternative estimator is superior by using Hausman-type tests of misspecification. Measures of value at risk are also provided for the seven markets. We also find that the largest estimated value at risk by far is for the Japanese Yen, followed by the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the New Zealand dollar and the Australian dollar. The UK pound has the smallest value at risk when extreme movements occur. © 2012 Taylor &amp; Francis.","A number of applications presume that asset returns are normally distributed, even though they are widely known to be skewed leptokurtic and fat-tailed and excess kurtosis. This leads to the underestimation or overestimation of the true value-at-risk (VaR). This study utilizes a composite trapezoid rule, a numerical integral method, for estimating quantiles on the skewed generalized t distribution (SGT) which permits returns innovation to flexibly treat skewness, leptokurtosis and fat tails. Daily spot prices of the thirteen stock indices in North America, Europe and Asia provide data for examining the one-day-ahead VaR forecasting performance of the GARCH model with normal, student's t and SGT distributions. Empirical results indicate that the SGT provides a good fit to the empirical distribution of the log-returns followed by student's t and normal distributions. Moreover, for all confidence levels, all models tend to underestimate real market risk. Furthermore, the GARCH-based model, with SGT distributional setting, generates the most conservative VaR forecasts followed by student's t and normal distributions for a long position. Consequently, it appears reasonable to conclude that, from the viewpoint of accuracy, the influence of both skewness and fat-tails effects (SGT) is more important than only the effect of fat-tails (student's t) on VaR estimates in stock markets for a long position. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Computable expressions are derived for the Expected Shortfall of portfolios whose value is a quadratic function of a number of risk factors, as arise from a Delta-Gamma-Theta approximation. The risk factors are assumed to follow an elliptical multivariatetdistribution, reflecting the heavy-tailed nature of asset returns.

The latter is essentially explicit, and numerical experiments suggest that its error is negligible compared to that incurred by the Delta-Gamma-Theta approximation. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","This paper extends the canonical model of contagion proposed by Pesaran and Pick [Pesaran, M.H., Pick,A., 2007.

We use asset pricing theory to determine the appropriate hurdle rate, finding that this varies with the skewness of asset returns. We quantify this discrepancy under a range of assumptions showing that the RAROC hurdle rate differs substantially, being higher by a factor of five or more for equity which has a right skew compared to debt which has a pronounced left skew, and also between different qualities of debt exposure. We discuss implications for both financial institution risk management and supervision. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a widely used tool for assessing financial market risk. In practice, the estimation of liquidity extreme risk by VaR generally uses models assuming independence of bid-ask spreads. However, bid-ask spreads tend to occur in clusters with time dependency, particularly during crisis period. Our paper attempts to fill this gap by studying the impact of negligence of dependency in liquidity extreme risk assessment of Tunisian stock market. The main methods which take into account returns dependency to assess market risk is Time series-Extreme Value Theory combination. Therefore we compare VaRs estimated under independency (Variance-Covariance Approach, Historical Simulation and the VaR adjusted to extreme values) relatively to the VaR when dependence is considered. The efficiency of those methods was tested and compared using the backtesting tests. The results confirm the adequacy of the recent extensions of liquidity risk in the VaR estimation. Therefore, we prove a performance improvement of VaR estimates under the assumption of dependency across a significant reduction of the estimation error, particularly with AR (1)-GARCH (1,1)-GPD model. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Historical Simulation (HS) and its variant, the Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS), are the most popular Value-at-Risk forecast methods at commercial banks. These forecast methods are traditionally evaluated by means of the unconditional backtest. This paper formally shows that the unconditional backtest is always inconsistent for backtesting HS and FHS models, with a power function that can be even smaller than the nominal level in large samples. Our findings have fundamental implications in the determination of market risk capital requirements, and also explain Monte Carlo and empirical findings in previous studies. We also propose a data-driven weighted backtest with good power properties to evaluate HS and FHS forecasts. A Monte Carlo study and an empirical application with three US stocks confirm our theoretical findings. The empirical application shows that multiplication factors computed under the current regulatory framework are downward biased, as they inherit the inconsistency of the unconditional backtest. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","This paper investigates the behaviour of spot prices in eight energy markets that trade futures contracts on NYMEX. We consider two types of models, a mean-reverting model, and a spike model with mean reversion that incorporates two different speeds of mean reversion; one for the fast mean-reverting behaviour of prices after a jump occurs, and another for the slower mean reversion rate of the diffusive part of the model. We also extend these models to incorporate time-varying volatility in their specification, modelled as a GARCH and an EGARCH process. We compare the relative goodness of fit of the different modelling variations both in sample, using Monte Carlo simulations, as well as out-of-sample, in a Value-at-Risk (VaR) setting. Our results indicate the presence of a \"leverage effect\" for WTI, Heating Oil and Heating Oil-WTI crack spread, whereas for the remaining energy markets we find the presence of an \"inverse leverage\" effect. Also, the addition of the EGARCH specification for the volatility process improves both the in-sample fit as well as the out-of-sample VaR performance for most energy markets that we examine. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","The impact of undiversified idiosyncratic risk on value-at-risk and expected shortfall can be approximated analytically via a methodology known as granularity adjustment (GA). In principle, the GA methodology can be applied to any risk-factor model of portfolio risk. Thus far, however, analytical results have been derived only for simple models of actuarial loss, i.e., credit loss due to default. We demonstrate that the GA is entirely tractable for single-factor versions of a large class of models that includes all the commonly used mark-to-market approaches. Our approach covers both finite ratings-based models and models with a continuum of obligor states. We apply our methodology to CreditMetrics and KMV Portfolio Manager, as these are benchmark models for the finite and continuous classes, respectively. Comparative statics of the GA reveal striking and counterintuitive patterns. We explain these relationships with a stylized model of portfolio risk. © 2012.","This article proposes a new methodology for measuring Value-at-Risk (hereafter VaR) using a model that incorporates both volatility and jumps.

This article specifically uses a two-factor HJM jumpdiffusion model for the computation. The study models the Eurodollar futures prices using its derivatives. In addition, this article uses a new volatility specification of Ze-To (2002) to construct the HJM dynamics.

The ongoing financial crisis has perfectly exemplified this point. Surprisingly, there are few studies exploring this issue for REITs. This study aims to close the knowledge gap. We conduct a comprehensive study by utilizing all three methodological categories to examine their forecasting performances of VaR and ES for nine major global REIT markets. Our findings indicate that there is no universally adequate method to model extreme risks across global markets. Also, estimating risks for the stock and REIT markets may require different methods. In addition, we compare the risk profiles between the stock and REIT markets, and find that the extreme risks for REITs are generally higher than those of stock markets. The fluctuations of risk levels are well synchronized between the two types of markets. The current crisis has significantly increased the extreme risk exposure for both REIT and stock investors. In all, our results have significant implications for REIT risk management, portfolio selection, and evaluation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","This paper evaluates several alternative formulations for minimizing the credit risk of a portfolio of financial contracts with different counterparties. Credit risk optimization is challenging because the portfolio loss distribution is typically unavailable in closed form. This makes it difficult to accurately compute Value-at-Risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) at the extreme quantiles that are of practical interest to financial institutions. Our formulations all exploit the conditional independence of counterparties under a structural credit risk model. We consider various approximations to the conditional portfolio loss distribution and formulate VaR and ES minimization problems for each case. We use two realistic credit portfolios to assess the in- and out-of-sample performance for the resulting VaR- and ES-optimized portfolios, as well as for those which we obtain by minimizing the variance or the second moment of the portfolio losses. We find that a Normal approximation to the conditional loss distribution performs best from a practical standpoint. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","With the regulatory requirements for risk management, Value at Risk (VaR) has become an essential tool in determining capital reserves to protect the risk induced by adverse market movements. The fact that VaR is not coherent has motivated the industry to explore alternative risk measures such as expected shortfall.

In addition to the expected shortfall, we investigate a new tool called median shortfall to measure risk. The second objective of this paper is to develop backtesting methods for assessing the performance of expected shortfall and median shortfall estimators from statistical and financial perspectives. By applying our expected shortfall estimators and other existing approaches to seven international markets, we demonstrate the superiority of our methods with respect to statistical and practical evaluations. Our expected shortfall estimators likely provide an unbiased reference for setting the minimum capital required for safeguarding against expected loss. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian methodology for Value-at-Risk computation based on parametric Product Partition Models. Value-at-Risk is a standard tool for measuring and controlling the market risk of an asset or portfolio, and is also required for regulatory purposes. Its popularity is partly due to the fact that it is an easily understood measure of risk. The use of Product Partition Models allows us to remain in a Normal setting even in the presence of outlying points, and to obtain a closed-form expression for Value-at-Risk computation. We present and compare two different scenarios: a product partition structure on the vector of means and a product partition structure on the vector of variances. We apply our methodology to an Italian stock market data set from Mib30. The numerical results clearly show that Product Partition Models can be successfully exploited in order to quantify market risk exposure. The obtained Value-at-Risk estimates are in full agreement with Maximum Likelihood approaches, but our methodology provides richer information about the clustering structure of the data and the presence of outlying points. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","The aim of this paper is to introduce a new property for good quantile or Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimators. We define probability unbiasedness for the α-quantile estimator from a finite amount of data (Q̂ α) for the distribution function F θ with parameter θ such that the estimator also has this probabilistic 'threshold property' in expectation of a F θ distributed random variable X for all θ, i.e. Probability unbiasedness means that the α-quantile estimated from a finite amount of data is only exceeded by probability α for the next observation from the same distribution. Moreover, we show that plug-in estimators for estimating quantiles at a given probability are not unbiased with respect to the probability unbiasedness property, i.e. using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator for the parameters and plugging in the estimated values into the distribution function to obtain the quantile values. Therefore, estimating a quantile needs to be corrected for observing only finitely many samples with a distortion function to obtain a probability-unbiased estimator. In the case of estimating the VaR (quantile) of a normally distributed random variable, the distortion function is calculated via the distribution of the VaR/quantile. Using the distribution derived for the VaR estimate, we also quantify the approximate probability-unbiased confidence bands of the VaR for a finite amount of data. In the last part, the new VaR estimator is tested on a time series. It outperforms the other models examined, all of which are much more complex. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","The recent financial crisis of 2007-2009 has challenged the requirements of Basel II agreement on capital adequacy as well as, the appropriateness of value-at-risk (VaR) measurement for properly \"back-tested\" and \"stress-tested\" models.

We incorporate a GARCH model where the innovation process follows the Pearson-IV distribution, and the results are compared with the skewed Student-t distribution, in the sense of Fernandez and Steel. As case studies we consider the major historical indices of daily returns, DJIA, NASDAQ Composite, FTSE100, CAC40, DAX, and S&amp;P500. VaR and backtesting are performed by the success-failure ratio, the Kupiec LR test, the Christoffersen independence and conditional coverage tests, the expected shortfall with ESF1 and ESF2 measures, and the dynamic quantile test of Engle and Manganelli. The main findings indicate that the Pearson type-IV distribution gives better results, compared with the skewed student distribution, especially at the high confidence levels, providing a very good candidate as an alternative distributional scheme. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","This paper studies the link between two popular measures of risk, that are the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and the Tail-VaR (TVaR). We study how the TVaR and VaR are related through their risk levels and characterize the underlying distributions under which this relationship is linear. A large portion of this paper is devoted to the related econometric analysis, such as the estimation and test of this relationship. We apply the results to currency portfolios and observe that this linearity relationship between the TVaR and VaR is a surprisingly common phenomenon for the portfolios considered for both historical and conditional risk measures. © The Author 2012.

This paper advocates a Mixture of Markov Chains (MMC) model to account for stochastic business cycle effects in credit rating migration risk. The MMC approach is more efficient and provides superior out-of-sample credit rating migration risk predictions at long horizons than a naïve approach that conditions deterministically on the business cycle phase. Banks using the MMC estimator would counter-cyclically increase capital by 6% during economic expansion and free up to 17% capital for lending during downturns relative to the naïve estimator.

The state variables have a macrofactor interpretation. The results are applied to maximum likelihood estimation of a macroparameter and to computation of a granularity adjusted Value-at-Risk (VaR) for large portfolios. The granularity adjustment for VaR is illustrated by an application of the value of the firm model Merton, 1974, Journal of Finance 29, 449-470) taking into account both default and loss given default. © The Author 2011.

Investors must account for this correlation when determining the extent of foreign exchange risk in emerging market equity portfolio investments. This study employs a VaR risk factor mapping technique, under the variance-covariance VaR approach, to decompose portfolio risk in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Russia. For comparison purposes, the same technique is used to decompose portfolio risk in the US. The study is conducted from the perspective of a European equity investor with a portfolio of equities in each country. By employing the VaR decomposition technique, the correlation between a portfolio's equity and foreign exchange components is taken into account and portfolio foreign exchange risk is extracted from portfolio systematic risk. Our results uniquely demonstrate significant variation in foreign exchange risk in emerging markets. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Financial market crashes can occur even in the absence of news. This paper highlights four properties of price-contingent trading that increase the frequency of such events. Price-contingent trading is common across financial market, since it includes algorithmic trading, technical trading, and dynamic option hedging. The four properties we consider are: (1) high kurtosis in the distribution of order sizes; (2) clustering of trades within the day; (3) clustering of trades at certain prices; and (4) feedback between trading and returns. The paper estimates the relative importance of these factors using data from the foreign exchange market. Calibrated simulations indicate that interactions among these factors are at least as important as any single one. Among individual factors, the orders' size distribution and feedback effects have the strongest influence. Overall, price-contingent trading could account for half of realized excess kurtosis. The paper suggests that extreme returns unaccompanied by news are statistically inevitable in the presence of price-contingent trading. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Variance targeting estimation (VTE) is a technique used to alleviate the numerical difficulties encountered in the quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) of GARCH models. It relies on a reparameterization of the model and a first-step estimation of the unconditional variance. The remaining parameters are estimated by quasi maximum likelihood (QML) in a second step. This paper establishes the asymptotic distribution of the estimators obtained by this method in univariate GARCH models. Comparisons with the standard QML are provided and the merits of the variance targeting method are discussed. In particular, it is shown that when the model is misspecified, the VTE can be superior to the QMLE for long-term prediction or value-at-risk calculation. An empirical application based on stock market indices is proposed. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

For each currency, we use three risk measures simultaneously that pertain to that currency; its realized volatility, its realized skewness, and its value-at-risk. We apply monthly FX excess returns and risk measures calculated from daily observations. We find that there is a significant contemporaneous risk-return trade-off for the currencies under investigation. There is no evidence of noncontemporaneous risk-return trade-off. We pay special attention to the risk-return trade-off during the recent financial crisis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Banks hold capital to guard against unexpected surges in losses and long freezes in financial markets. The minimum level of capital is set by banking regulators as a function of the banks'. own estimates of their risk exposures. As a result, a great challenge for both banks and regulators is to validate internal risk models. We show that a large fraction of US and international banks uses contaminated data when testing their models. In particular, most banks validate their market risk model using profit-and-loss (P/L) data that include fees and commissions and intraday trading revenues. This practice is inconsistent with the definition of the employed market risk measure. Using both bank data and simulations, we find that data contamination has dramatic implications for model validation and can lead to the acceptance of misspecified risk models. Moreover, our estimates suggest that the use of contaminated data can significantly reduce (market-risk induced) regulatory capital. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","The estimation of medium-term market risk dictated by limited data availability, is a challenging issue of concern amongst academics and practitioners. This paper addresses the issue by exploiting the concepts of volatility and quantile scaling in order to determine the best method for extrapolating medium-term risk forecasts from high frequency data. Additionally, market risk model selection is investigated for a new dataset on ocean tanker freight rates, which refer to the income of the capital good - tanker vessels. Certain idiosyncrasies inherent in the very competitive shipping freight rate markets, such as excessive volatility, cyclicality of returns and the medium-term investment horizons - found in few other markets - make these issues challenging. Findings indicate that medium-term risk exposures can be estimated accurately by using an empirical scaling law which outperforms the conventional scaling laws of the square and tail index root of time. Regarding the market risk model selection for short-term investment horizons, findings contradict most studies on conventional financial assets: interestingly, freight rate market risk quantification favors simpler specifications, such as the GARCH and the historical simulation models. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","A multiple-regime threshold generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic capital asset pricing model is introduced. The model captures asymmetric risk through allowing market beta to change discretely between regimes that are driven by market information. Asymmetric volatility and mean equation dynamics are also captured. We confirm the time varying nature of market risk, in response to changes in the market, and that this discrete time variation can differ across assets. These findings could have important implications for optimizing investment decisions: e.g. in risk assessment, portfolio selection and hedging decisions. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","With the increasing level of volatility in the crude oil market, the transient data feature becomes more prevalent in the market and is no longer ignorable during the risk measurement process. Since there are multiple representations for these transient data features using a set of bases available, the sparsity measure based Morphological Component Analysis (MCA) model is proposed in this paper to find the optimal combinations of representations to model these transient data features. Therefore, this paper proposes a MCA based hybrid methodology for analyzing and forecasting the risk evolution in the crude oil market. The underlying transient data components with distinct behaviors are extracted and analyzed using MCA model. The proposed algorithm incorporates these transient data features to adjust for conservative risk estimates from traditional approach based on normal market condition during its risk measurement process.

It offers four major findings. First, the stock and oil futures prices are inter-related. Their correlation follows a time-varying dynamic process and tends to increase when the markets are more volatile. Second, conditioned on the past information, the volatility in each market is very persistent, i.e., it varies in a predictable manner. Third, there is inter-market dependence in volatility. Innovations that hit either market can affect the volatility in the other market. In other words, conditioned on the persistence and the past volatility in their respective markets, the past volatility of the stock (oil futures) market also has predictive power over the future volatility of the oil futures (stock) market. Finally, the model produces more accurate Value-at-Risk estimates than other benchmarks commonly used in the financial industry. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Alexander and Baptista [2002. Economic implications of using a mean-value-at-risk (VaR) model for portfolio selection: A comparison with mean-variance analysis.

In particular, they identify the minimum VaR portfolio as a special type of mean-variance efficient portfolio. Our empirical analysis finds that, for commonly used VaR breach probabilities, minimum VaR portfolios yield ex post returns that conform well with the specified VaR breach probabilities and with return/risk expectations. These results provide a considerable extension of evidence supporting the empirical validity and tractability of the mean-VaR efficiency concept. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","There appears to be a consensus that the recent instability in global financial markets may be attributable in part to the failure of financial modeling. More specifically, it is alleged that current risk models have failed to properly assess the risks associated with large adverse stock price behavior. In this paper, we first discuss the limitations of classical time series models for forecasting financial market meltdowns. Then we set forth a framework capable of forecasting both extreme events and highly volatile markets. Based on the empirical evidence presented in this paper, our framework offers an improvement over prevailing models for evaluating stock market risk exposure during distressed market periods. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","The financial crisis of 2007-2009 has questioned the provisions of Basel II agreement on capital adequacy requirements and the appropriateness of VaR measurement. This paper reconsiders the use of Value-at-risk as a measure for potential risk of economic losses in financial markets by estimating VaR for daily stock returns with the application of various parametric univariate models that belong to the class of ARCH models which are based on the skewed Student distribution. We used daily data for three groups of stock market indices, namely Developed, Southeast Asia and Latin America. The data covered the period 1987-2009. We conducted our analysis with the adoption of the methodology suggested by Giot and Laurent (2003). Therefore, we estimated an APARCH model based on the skewed Student distribution to fully take into account the fat left and right tails of the returns distribution. The main finding of our analysis is that the skewed Student APARCH improves considerably the forecasts of one-day-ahead VaR for long and short trading positions. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of each model with the calculation of Kupiec's (1995) Likelihood Ratio test on the empirical failure test. Moreover, for the case of the skewed Student APARCH model we computed the expected shortfall and the average multiple of tail event to risk measure. These two measures helped us to further assess the information we obtained from the estimation of the empirical failure rates. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","This study is on valuing Asian strike options and presents efficient and accurate quadratic approximation methods that work extremely well, both with regard to the volatility of a wide range of underlying assets, and longer average time windows. We demonstrate that most of the well-known quadratic approximation methods used in the literature for pricing Asian strike options are special cases of our model, with the numerical results demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms the other quadratic approximation methods examined here. Using our method for the calculation of hundreds of Asian strike options, the pricing errors (in terms of the root mean square errors) are reasonably small. Compared with the Monte Carlo benchmark method, our method is shown to be rapid and accurate. We further extend our method to the valuing of quanto forward-starting Asian strike options, with the pricing accuracy of these options being largely the same as the pricing of plain vanilla Asian strike options. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the possible influences of jump dynamics, heavy-tails, and skewness with regard to VaR estimates through the assessment of both accuracy and efficiency. To this end, the ARJI model, and its degenerative GARCH model with normal, GED, and skewed normal (SN) distributions were adopted to capture the properties of time-varying volatility, time-varying jump intensity, heavy-tails and skewness, for a range of stock indices across international stock markets during the period of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis. Empirical results show that, with regard to the evaluation of accuracy, the role of jump dynamics is more substantial than heavy-tails or skewness as it pertains to VaR accuracy at the 90% and 95% levels, while heavy-tails become more important at the 99% level for a long position. However, the influence of the abovementioned properties on VaR estimation does not appear substantial for a short position. In addition, the properties of jump dynamics and skewness appear to be beneficial for the improvement of efficiency. © 2010.","The square-root-of-time rule (SRTR) is popular in assessing multi-period VaR; however, it makes several unrealistic assumptions. We examine and reconcile different stylized factors in returns that contribute to the SRTR scaling distortions. In complementing the use of the variance ratio test, we propose a new intuitive subsampling-based test for the overall validity of the SRTR. The results indicate that serial dependence and heavy-tailedness may severely bias the applicability of SRTR, while jumps or volatility clustering may be less relevant. To mitigate the first-order effect from time dependence, we suggest a simple modified-SRTR for scaling tail risks. By examining 47 markets globally, we find the SRTR to be lenient, in that it generally yields downward-biased 10-day and 30-day VaRs, particularly in Eastern Europe, Central-South America, and the Asia Pacific. Nevertheless, accommodating the dependence correction is a notable improvement over the traditional SRTR. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","The problem of risk portfolio optimization with translation-invariant and positive-homogeneous risk measures, which includes value-at-risk (VaR) and tail conditional expectation (TCE), leads to the problem of minimizing a combination of a linear functional and a square root of a quadratic functional for the case of elliptical multivariate underlying distributions. In this paper, we provide an explicit closed-form solution of this minimization problem, and the condition under which this solution exists. The results are illustrated using the data of 10 stocks from NASDAQ/Computers.

Using simple J-statistic based on the moments defined by the orthonormal polynomials associated with the geometric distribution, this new approach tackles most of the drawbacks usually associated to duration-based backtesting procedures. An empirical application for Nasdaq returns confirms that using GMMtest leads to major consequences for the expost evaluation of the risk by regulation authorities. © The Author 2010.

Using a sample of NYMEX and ICE futures contracts, we establish the existence of a regime process and link this process to market fundamentals. This formulation results in two distinct states: a highly persistent conditional volatility process, characterised by long memory and low sensitivity to market shocks, and a relatively short-lived nonstationary process with less memory but higher sensitivity to shocks. Moreover, to investigate the relationship between disequilibrium and volatility of oil futures across high and low volatility regimes we use augmented regime GARCH models to address in a realistic way the potential diverse response of volatility to forward curve shocks. The performance of these models is compared to benchmarks, using both statistical tests and risk management loss functions. To test the robustness of the forecasting strategies, we also perform a reality check employing the stationary bootstrap approach. The findings of this paper have important implications for decision making concerning trading and risk management, as well as energy market operations, such as refining and budget planning, by providing valuable information on the oil price volatility dynamics and the ability to predict risk. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","In the past, petroleum companies only paid attention to hedging the variation in the crude oil price and volatility. However, they have now expanded their analysis to encompass renewable sources, such as corn and soybeans, under the current low-carbon biofuel obligations. This paper employs GARCH(1,1) and ARJI models to estimate the one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) of the optimal dynamic biofuel portfolio, which consists of crude oil, corn and soybeans. The optimal blended standard is subject to the dual limitations of minimum production costs and the lowest biofuel using requirements. Our empirical findings confirm that the ARJI model is more suitable than the GARCH (1,1) model and further captures the discontinuous jump behavior from the in-the-sample data. The results of out-of-sample forecasts also are represented that our models play important roles in VaR estimation and risk management for biofuel portfolio. We therefore suggest that the petroleum companies should simultaneously pay attention to jump risk in hedging material costs in the prices of energy-related crops. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","This paper compares traditional portfolio insurance strategies with modern risk-based dynamic asset allocation strategies within a currency portfolio context for reserve management. Given the objective of preserving reserve value, the evaluation of the hedging performances of various strategies focuses on four perspectives regarding, in particular, the return distribution of the hedged portfolio. In terms of the Sharpe Ratio, the constant proportional portfolio insurance is the best performer due to having the lowest volatility, while the Value at Risk strategy based upon the normal distribution is the worst due to its having the smallest return. From the perspective that the return distribution of the hedged portfolio is shifted to the right, the synthetic put performs the best, with the expected shortfall strategy the second best. In terms of the cumulative portfolio return across years, the expected shortfall strategy using the historical distribution ranks first, as a result of its participation in upward markets. Furthermore, the expected shortfall-based strategy results in a lower turnover within the investment horizon, thereby saving transaction costs. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","The implementation of appropriate statistical techniques (backtesting) for monitoring conditional VaR models is the mechanism used by financial institutions to determine the severity of departures of the VaR model from market results and subsequently, the tool used by regulators to determine the penalties imposed for inadequate risk models. So far, however, there has been no attempt to determine the timing of this rejection and with it to obtain some guidance regarding the cause of failure in reporting an appropriate VaR. This paper corrects this by proposing U-statistic type processes that extend standard CUSUM statistics widely employed for change-point detection. In contrast to CUSUM statistics these new tests are indexed by certain weight functions that enhance their statistical power to detect the timing of the market risk model failure. These tests are robust to estimation risk and can be devised to be very sensitive to detection of market failure produced early in the out-of-sample evaluation period, in which standard methods usually fail due to the absence of data. © 2011 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

The empirical results indicate that the forecasted Value-at-Risk (VaR) obtained using the SGT distribution provides the most accurate out-of-sample forecasts for both the petroleum and metal markets. With regard to the unconditional and conditional coverage tests, the SGT distribution produces the most appropriate VaR estimates in terms of the total number of rejections; this is followed by the nonparametric distribution, generalized error distribution (GED), and finally the normal distribution. Similarly, in the dynamic quantile test, the VaR estimates generated by the SGT and nonparametric distributions perform better than that generated by other distributions. Finally, in the superior predictive test, the SGT distribution has significantly lower capital requirements than the nonparametric distribution for most commodities. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Backtesting methods are statistical tests designed to uncover value-at-risk (VaR) models not capable of reporting the correct unconditional coverage probability or filtering the serial dependence in the data. We show in this paper that these methods are subject to the presence of model risk produced by the incorrect specification of the conditional VaR model and derive its effect in the asymptotic distribution of the relevant out-of-sample tests. We also show that in the absence of estimation risk, the unconditional backtest is affected by model misspecification but the independence test is not. We propose using resampling methods to implement robust backtests. Our experiments suggest that block-bootstrap outperforms subsampling methods in size accuracy. We carry out a Monte Carlo study to see the importance of model risk in finite samples for location-scale models that are incorrectly specified but correct on \"average\".

This shows that the structures of the forecast equations are identical, but with different dependencies on the forecast horizon. The process equations for the forward variance are induced by the process equations for an ARCH model, but postulated in a market model. In the ARCH case, they are different from the usual diffusive type. The conceptual differences between both approaches and their implication for volatility forecasts are analysed. The volatility forecast is compared with the realized volatility (the volatility that will occur between date t and t + Δ T), and the implied volatility (corresponding to an at-the-money option with expiry at t + Δ T). For the ARCH forecasts, the parameters are set a priori. An empirical analysis across multiple time horizons Δ T shows that a forecast provided by an I-GARCH(1) process (one time scale) does not capture correctly the dynamics of the realized volatility. An I-GARCH(2) process (two time scales, similar to GARCH(1,1)) is better, while a longmemory LM-ARCH process (multiple time scales) replicates correctly the dynamics of the implied and realized volatilities and delivers consistently good forecasts for the realized volatility. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.","The Basel II framework allows the calculation of the capital requirements for market risk with Value-at-Risk models. Since no special model is prescribed in the framework, banks may use simple models with questionable assumptions concerning their underlying distributions. Our numerical analysis reveals that simple VaR models that perform noticeably worse than comparable simple models with more realistic assumptions may lead to a lower level of regulatory capital for banks. For this reason, banks have a major incentive to implement bad models. This is obviously contrary to the interests of regulatory authorities. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.","This article proposes omnibus specification tests of parametric dynamic quantile models. In contrast to the existing procedures, we allow for a flexible specification, where a possible continuum of quantiles is simultaneously specified under fairly weak conditions on the serial dependence in the underlying data-generating process.

This may lead to implausible characteristics of the estimates. Outliers, especially, can make a modeler's task difficult and can result in arbitrarily large capital charges. Robust statistics provides ways to deal with these problems as well as measures for the reliability of estimators. We show that using maximum likelihood estimation can be misleading and unreliable assuming typical operational risk severity distributions.

The traditional mean-variance framework for portfolio selection should, however, be revised when the investor's concern is the VaR instead of the standard deviation. This is especially true when asset returns are not normal. In this paper, we incorporate VaR in portfolio selection, and we propose a mean-VaR efficient frontier. Due to the two-objective optimization problem that is associated with the mean-VaR framework, an evolutionary multi-objective approach is required to construct the mean-VaR efficient frontier. Specifically, we consider the elitist non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). From our empirical analysis, we conclude that the risk-averse investor might inefficiently allocate his/her wealth if his/her decision is based on the mean-variance framework. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.","We consider the problem of unobserved components in time series from a Bayesian non-parametric perspective.

However, it is important that the assumed models are consistent with the stylized facts. For example selecting a normal distribution permits modeling two data characteristics-the mean and the variance, but it is not appropriate for data which are skewed or have thick tails. The adaptive methods developed here offer the flexibility found in many machine learning models, but lend themselves to statistical interpretation, as well. This paper contributes to the development of partially adaptive estimation methods that derive their adaptability from membership in families of distributions, which are distinguished by modifications of simple parameters.

We define the notion of 'risk measurement procedure', which includes both of these steps, and introduce a rigorous framework for studying the robustness of risk measurement procedures and their sensitivity to changes in the data set. Our results point to a conflict between the subadditivity and robustness of risk measurement procedures and show that the same risk measure may exhibit quite different sensitivities depending on the estimation procedure used. Our results illustrate, in particular, that using recently proposed risk measures such as CVaR/expected shortfall leads to a less robust risk measurement procedure than historical Value-at-Risk.

While Basel II backtests VaR by counting the number of exceptions, this paper proposes to use the saddlepoint technique by summing the sizes of tail losses. Monte Carlo simulations show that the technique is extremely accurate and powerful, even for small samples. Empirical applications for the proposed backtest find substantial downside tail risks in S&amp;P 500, and demonstrate that risk models which account for jumps, skewed and fat-tailed distributions failed to capture the tail risk during the 1987 stock market crash.

There are however limitations of some widely-used risk management methods that either calculate risk measures under the Gaussian distributional assumption or involve numerical difficulty. The primary aim of this paper is to present a realistic and fast method, GHICA, which overcomes the limitations in multivariate risk analysis. The idea is to first retrieve independent components (ICs) out of the observed high-dimensional time series and then individually and adaptively fit the resulting ICs in the generalized hyperbolic (GH) distributional framework. For the volatility estimation of each IC, the local exponential smoothing technique is used to achieve the best possible accuracy of estimation. Finally, the fast Fourier transformation technique is used to approximate the density of the portfolio returns. The proposed GHICA method is applicable to covariance estimation as well. It is compared with the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) method based on the simulated data with d = 50 GH distributed components. We further implement the GHICA method to calculate risk measures given 20-dimensional German DAX portfolios and a dynamic exchange rate portfolio.

To measure the level of VaR disclosures, we develop a VaR Disclosure Index that captures many different facets of market risk disclosure. Using panel data over the period 1996-2005, we find an overall upward trend in the quantity of information released to the public. We also find that Historical Simulation is by far the most popular VaR method. We assess the accuracy of VaR figures by studying the number of VaR exceedances and whether actual daily VaRs contain information about the volatility of subsequent trading revenues. Unlike the level of VaR disclosure, the quality of VaR disclosure shows no sign of improvement over time. We find that VaR computed using Historical Simulation contains very little information about future volatility. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using Standard&amp;Poor's ratings from 1996 to 2005, we apply a novel approach to estimate a transition matrix that is sensitive to previous downgrades and contrast it with an insensitive benchmark matrix. First, we find that, under representative economic conditions, investors who rely on insensitive transition matrices underestimate the momentum-sensitive Value-at-Risk (VaR), on average, by 107 basis points. Second, we show that bond portfolio managers should use our downgrade-sensitive probabilities of default as they seem to be better calibrated than momentum-insensitive estimates. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.","It is well-established that equity returns are not Normally distributed, but what should the portfolio manager do about this, and is it worth the effort?

These can be efficiently fitted to data, and show a much better fit to real returns than the Normal distribution. By examining efficient frontiers computed using different distributional assumptions, we show, using for illustration five stocks chosen from the Dow index, that the choice of distribution has a significant effect on how much available return can be captured by an optimal portfolio on the efficient frontier. © 2010 Taylor &amp; Francis.","The paper is the first attempt to estimate systematic risk 'beta' at different time scales in the context of the emerging Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) equity markets by applying a relatively new approach in finance known as wavelet analysis. Our results indicate that on average beta coefficients in all GCC countries show a multiscale tendency. This is consistent with our theoretical expectation that stock market investors have different time horizons due to different trading strategies and that is also reflective of the characteristics of the GCC markets in particular in that they are less developed, less liquid, involve more transaction costs, highly dependent on individual investors, and prone to infrequent trading. Further, we analyze the impact of different time scales on Value at Risk (VaR) and find that VaR measured at different time scales suggests that risk tends to be concentrated more at the higher frequencies (lower time scales) of the data.

Therefore, appropriately constructed tests for assessing the out-of-sample forecast accuracy of the VaR model (backtesting procedures) have become of crucial practical importance. In this article we show that the use of the standard unconditional and independence backtesting procedures to assess VaR models in out-of-sample composite environments can be misleading. These tests do not consider the impact of estimation risk, and therefore, may use wrong critical values to assess market risk. The purpose of this article is to quantify such estimation risk in a very general class of dynamic parametric VaR models and to correct standard backtesting procedures to provide valid inference in out-of-sample analyses. A Monte Carlo study illustrates our theoretical findings in finite-samples and shows that our corrected unconditional test can provide more accurately sized and more powerful tests than the uncorrected one. Finally, an application to the S&amp;P 500 Index shows the importance of this correction and its impact on capital requirements as imposed by the Basel Accord. © 2010 American Statistical Association.","A pervasive and puzzling feature of banks' Value-at-Risk (VaR) is its abnormally high level, which leads to excessive regulatory capital. A possible explanation for the tendency of commercial banks to overstate their VaR is that they incompletely account for the diversification effect among broad risk categories (e.g., equity, interest rate, commodity, credit spread, and foreign exchange). By underestimating the diversification effect, bank's proprietary VaR models produce overly prudent market risk assessments. In this paper, we examine empirically the validity of this hypothesis using actual VaR data from major US commercial banks. In contrast to the VaR diversification hypothesis, we find that US banks show no sign of systematic underestimation of the diversification effect. In particular, diversification effects used by banks is very close to (and quite often larger than) our empirical diversification estimates. A direct implication of this finding is that individual VaRs for each broad risk category, just like aggregate VaRs, are biased risk assessments. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our empirical investigation shows, first, that the proposed risk measure consistently exceeds the benchmark value-at-risk (VaR). Second, jump risk tends to amplify intra-horizon risk. Third, we find large variation in our risk measure across jump models, indicative of model risk. Fourth, among the jump models we consider, the finite-moment log-stable model provides the most conservative risk estimates. Fifth, imposing more stringent VaR levels accentuates the impact of intra-horizon risk in jump models. Finally, using an alternative benchmark VaR does not dilute the role of intra-horizon risk. Overall, we contribute by showing that ignoring intra-horizon risk can lead to underestimation of risk exposures. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In risk management, the nonnormal behavior of most financial time series calls for non-Gaussian dependences. The correct modeling of non-Gaussian dependences is, therefore, a key issue in the analysis of multivariate time series. In this article we use copula functions with adaptively estimated time-varying parameters for modeling the distribution of returns. Furthermore, we apply copulae to the estimation of Value-at-Risk of portfolios and show their better performance over the RiskMetrics approach. © 2009 American Statistical Association.","Under the Basel II Accord, banks and other authorized deposit-taking institutions are required to communicate their daily market risk estimates to the relevant national monetary authority at the beginning of each trading day, using one of a variety of value-at-risk (VaR) models to measure risk. The purpose of this paper is to provide a simple explanation and a set of prescriptions for managing VaR under the Basel II Accord. The commandments deal with understanding the Basel II colours, understanding the risk model before choosing, varying the choice of risk model, avoiding the green zone and being willing to violate, incurring large violations, stopping before the red zone, avoiding frequent violations, avoiding the estimation of large portfolios, aggregating portfolios into a single index and interpreting commandments sensibly as guidelines. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Credit risk is the most important type of risk in terms of monetary value. Another key risk measure is market risk, which is concerned with stocks and bonds, and related financial derivatives, as well as exchange rates and interest rates.

This paper uses the n-degree lower partial moment (LPM) models, of which VaR is a special case, to empirically analyse the effect of downside risk reduction on UK portfolio diversification and returns. Data on Managed Futures Funds are used to replicate the increasingly popular preference of investors for including hedge funds and fund-of-funds type investments in the UK equity portfolios. The result indicates, however that the potential benefits of fund diversification may deteriorate following reductions in downside risk tolerance levels. These results appear to reinforce the importance of risk (tolerance) perception, particularly downside risk, when making decisions to include Managed Futures Funds in UK equity portfolios as the empirical analysis suggests that this could negatively affect portfolio returns. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The model extends the existing models in two important ways. First, the components are allowed to be heteroscedastic regressions as the standard model with homoscedastic regressions can give a poor fit to heteroscedastic data, especially when the number of covariates is large. Furthermore, we typically need fewer components, which makes it easier to interpret the model and speeds up the computation. The second main extension is to introduce a novel variable selection prior into all the components of the model. The variable selection prior acts as a self-adjusting mechanism that prevents overfitting and makes it feasible to fit flexible high-dimensional surfaces. We use Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate the model. Simulated and real examples are used to show that the full generality of our model is required to fit a large class of densities, but also that special cases of the general model are interesting models for economic data. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Nobel Laureate Harry Markowitz is often referred to as the 'founder of Modern portfolio theory' and deservedly so given his enormous influence on the money management industry. However, it is my contention that he should also be referred to as the 'founder of Modern Risk Management' since his contributions to portfolio theory formed the basis for how risk is currently viewed and managed. More specifically, Markowitz argued that a portfolio of securities should be viewed through the lens of statistics where the probability distribution of its rate of return is evaluated in terms of its expected value and standard deviation. Since the ultimate selection of a portfolio involves the evaluation and management of risk as measured by standard deviation, it is clear that Markowitz's process of portfolio selection represents the birth of modern risk management whereby risk is quantified and controlled. In this paper, I will first, introduce value-at-risk as a measure of risk and how it relates to standard deviation, the risk measure at the heart of the model of Markowitz. Second, I will similarly introduce conditional value-at-risk (also known as expected shortfall) as a measure of risk and compare it with VaR. Third, I will briefly introduce stress testing as a supplemental means of controlling risk and will then present my conclusions. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Accumulator is a highly path dependant derivative structure that has been introduced as a retail financial product in recent years and becomes very popular in some Asian cities with its speculative nature. Despite its popularity, its pricing formula is not well known especially when there is a barrier structure. When the barrier in an accumulator contract is applied continuously, this paper obtains exact analytic pricing formulae for immediate settlement and for delay settlement. For discrete barrier, we also obtain analytic formulae which can approximate the fair price of an accumulator under both settlement methods. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the approximation is highly satisfactory. With price formulae in close forms, this paper further explains how to price the product fairly to fit into its zero-cost structure. The analytic formulae also help in computing the Greeks of an accumulator which are documented in this paper. An asymmetry can be observed here that when the buyer is suffering a loss, risk characteristics like delta and vega are substantially larger than when the buyer is enjoying a profit. This means that losing buyers will be more vulnerable to price changes and volatility changes than winning buyers. This is consistent with another observation in the paper that the value at risk for the buyer can be several times larger than that of the seller. © 2009 IEEE.","This paper proposes an approach to constructing the insured portfolios under the VaR-based portfolio insurance strategy (VBPI) and provides a comprehensive analysis of its hedging effectiveness in comparison with the buy-and-hold (B&amp;H) as well as the constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategies in the context of the Chinese market. The results show that both of the insurance strategies are able to limit the downward returns while retaining certain upside returns, and their capabilities of reshaping the return distributions increase as the guarantee or the confidence level rises. In general, the VBPI strategy tends to outperform the CPPI strategy in terms of both the degree of downside protection and the return performance. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The reason is because these models are unable to capture some important facts such as heavy tails and volatility clustering which indicate the presence of large fluctuations in returns. An alternative way is to use regime-switching models, the latter are able to capture the previous facts. Using regime-switching model, we propose an analytical approximation for multi-horizon conditional Value-at-Risk and a closed-form solution for conditional Expected Shortfall. By comparing the Value-at-Risks and Expected Shortfalls calculated analytically and using simulations, we find that the both approaches lead to almost the same result. Further, the analytical approach is less time and computer intensive compared to simulations, which are typically used in risk management. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Such prices have a notoriously high volatility, owing to the difficulty of storing electrical energy and the delays needed to adjust generation levels. In this context, forward contracts have become increasingly popular and understanding their dynamic is a problem facing many market players. This paper proposes a parsimonious parametric model, based on the price series of all n-month forward contracts (n = 1,2,3...), encompassing multiple zones. The model is then used for value at risk forecasts, which are backtested and compared with the ones in use by the risk management unit of an important electricity producer.

We use a notion of diversification based on majorization theory that will be explained in the text. The paper shows that the stylized fact that portfolio diversification is preferable is reversed for extremely heavy-tailed risks or returns. However, the stylized facts on diversification are robust to heavy-tailedness of risks or returns as long as their distributions are moderately heavy-tailed. Extensions of the results to the case of dependence, including convolutions of -symmetric distributions and models with common shocks are provided. © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Fixed income options contain substantial information on the price of interest rate volatility risk. In this paper, we ask if those options will also provide information related to other moments of the objective distribution of interest rates. Based on dynamic term structure models within the class of affine models, we find that interest rate options are useful for the identification of interest rate quantiles. Two three-factor models are adopted and their adequacy to estimate Value at Risk of zero-coupon bonds is tested. We find significant difference on the quantitative assessment of risk when options are (or not) included in the estimation process of each of these dynamic models. Statistical backtests indicate that bond estimated risk is clearly more adequate when options are adopted, although not yet completely satisfactory. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The continuous component corresponds to general market risk and the jump component is proportional to the event risk as defined in the Basel II accord. We find that event risk, which is currently not incorporated into most banks' VaR models, comprises a substantial part of total VaR. It constitutes 30% of the risk for a portfolio of small cap stocks but less than 1% for a portfolio of large cap stocks. The national supervising agency in each membership country is advised by the Basel rules to add an additional capital charge to a bank whose models do not capture event risk. The large variation in event risk, also found across 10 individual stocks, suggests that an approach that varies the capital surcharge, based on the type of asset, should be used by the supervisors. © The Author 2009.

Whereas in diffusion models with continuous trading, this strategy has no downside risk, in real markets this risk is nonnegligible and grows with the multiplier value. We study the behavior of CPPI strategies in models where the price of the underlying portfolio may experience downward jumps. Our framework leads to analytically tractable expressions for the probability of hitting the floor, the expected loss, and the distribution of losses. This allows to measure the gap risk but also leads to a criterion for adjusting the multiplier based on the investor's risk aversion. Finally, we study the problem of hedging the downside risk of a CPPI strategy using options. The results are applied to a jump-diffusion model with parameters estimated from returns series of various assets and indices. © Copyright the Authors.

Including value-at-risk, tail-value-at-risk, and limited expected loss, these constraints can be both wealth-dependent (relative) and wealth-independent (absolute). The optimal policy is shown to exist in an appropriate admissibility class, and can be obtained explicitly by uniform, state-dependent scaling down of the unconstrained (Merton) optimal portfolio. This implies that the risk-constrained wealth-growth optimizer locally behaves like a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) investor, with the relative risk-aversion coefficient depending on the current values of the market coefficients. © Copyright the Authors.

Most analysts believe that oil price fluctuations have considerable consequences on economic activity. Oil markets have become relatively free, resulting in a high degree of oil-price volatility and generating radical changes to world energy and oil industries. Consequently, oil markets are naturally vulnerable to significant high price shifts. An example of such a case is the oil embargo crisis of 1973. In this newly created climate, protection against market risk has become a necessity. Value at Risk (VaR) measures risk exposure at a given probability level and is very important for risk management. Appealing aspects of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) have made convincing arguments for its use in managing energy price risks. In this paper, we model VaR for long and short trading positions in oil market by applying both unconditional and conditional EVT models to forecast Value at Risk. These models are compared to the performances of other well-known modelling techniques, such as GARCH, Historical Simulation and Filtered Historical Simulation. Both conditional EVT and Filtered Historical Simulation procedures offer a major improvement over the conventional methods. Furthermore, GARCH(1, 1)-t model may provide equally good results which are comparable to two combined procedures. Finally, our results confirm the importance of filtering process for the success of standard approaches. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, these results do not necessarily extend to forecasting performance. This paper seeks answer to the question of whether RiskMetrics volatility forecasts are adequate in comparison to those obtained from GARCH models. To answer the question stock index data is taken from 31 international markets and subjected to two exercises, a straightforward volatility forecasting exercise and a Value-at-Risk exceptions forecasting competition. Our results provide some simple answers to the above question. When forecasting volatility of the G7 stock markets the APARCH model, in particular, provides superior forecasts that are significantly different from the RiskMetrics models in over half the cases. This result also extends to the European markets with the APARCH model typically preferred. For the Asian markets the RiskMetrics model performs well, and is only significantly dominated by the GARCH models for one market, although there is evidence that the APARCH model provides a better forecast for the larger Asian markets. Regarding the Value-at-Risk exercise, when forecasting the 1% VaR the RiskMetrics model does a poor job and is typically the worst performing model, again the APARCH model does well. However, forecasting the 5% VaR then the RiskMetrics model does provide an adequate performance. In short, the RiskMetrics model only performs well in forecasting the volatility of small emerging markets and for broader VaR measures. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we introduce a new concept of Granger causality in risk and propose a class of kernel-based tests to detect extreme downside risk spillover between financial markets, where risk is measured by the left tail of the distribution or equivalently by the Value at Risk (VaR). The proposed tests have a convenient asymptotic standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of no Granger causality in risk. They check a large number of lags and thus can detect risk spillover that occurs with a time lag or that has weak spillover at each lag but carries over a very long distributional lag. Usually, tests using a large number of lags may have low power against alternatives of practical importance, due to the loss of a large number of degrees of freedom. Such power loss is fortunately alleviated for our tests because our kernel approach naturally discounts higher order lags, which is consistent with the stylized fact that today's financial markets are often more influenced by the recent events than the remote past events. A simulation study shows that the proposed tests have reasonable size and power against a variety of empirically plausible alternatives in finite samples, including the spillover from the dynamics in mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis respectively. In particular, nonuniform weighting delivers better power than uniform weighting and a Granger-type regression procedure. The proposed tests are useful in investigating large comovements between financial markets such as financial contagions. An application to the Eurodollar and Japanese Yen highlights the merits of our approach. © 2009.","The Value-at-Risk of a delta-gamma approximated derivatives portfolio can be computed by numerical integration of the characteristic function. However, while the choice of parameters in any numerical integration scheme is paramount, in practice it often relies on ad hoc procedures of trial and error. For normal and multivariate t-distributed risk factors, we show how to calculate the necessary parameters for one particular integration scheme as a function of the data (the distribution of risk factors, and delta and gamma) in order to satisfy a given error tolerance. This allows for implementation in a fully automated risk management system. We also demonstrate in simulations that the method is significantly faster than the Monte Carlo method, for a given error tolerance. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The index θ of an EVaR is the relative cost of the expected margin shortfall and hence reflects the level of prudentiality. It is also shown that a given expectile corresponds to the quantiles with distinct tail probabilities under different distributions. Thus, an EVaR may be interpreted as a flexible QVaR, in the sense that its tail probability is determined by the underlying distribution. We further consider conditional EVaR and propose various Conditional AutoRegressive Expectile models that can accommodate some stylized facts in financial time series. For model estimation, we employ the method of asymmetric least squares proposed by Newey and Powell [Newey, W.K., Powell, J.L., 1987. Asymmetric least squares estimation and testing. Econometrica 55, 819-847] and extend their asymptotic results to allow for stationary and weakly dependent data. We also derive an encompassing test for non-nested expectile models. As an illustration, we apply the proposed modeling approach to evaluate the EVaR of stock market indices. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This is crucial for both trading, pricing and risk management of option positions. We suggest a simple, yet flexible, model, based on a discrete and linear Kalman filter updating of the volatility skew. From a risk management perspective, we assess whether this model is capable of producing good density forecasts of daily returns on a number of option portfolios. We also compare our model to the sticky-delta and the vega-gamma alternatives. We find that it clearly outperforms both alternatives, given its ability to easily account for movements of different nature in the volatility curve. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We provide weak stationarity conditions and unconditional moments to the fourth order. We apply this new class to Dow Jones index returns. We find that a two-component mixed exponential power distribution dominates mixed normal distributions with more components, and more parameters, both in-sample and out-of-sample. In contrast to mixed normal distributions, all the conditional variance processes become stationary. This happens because the mixed exponential power distribution allows for component-specific shape parameters so that it can better capture the tail behaviour. Therefore, the more general new class has attractive features over mixed normal distributions in our application: less components are necessary and the conditional variances in the components are stationary processes. Results on NASDAQ index returns are similar. Copyright © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

The approach is a parametric model using an ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) model where the tail events are modelled using fractional Lévy stable noise and Lévy stable distribution. Using high-frequency data for the German DAX Index, the VaR estimates from this approach are compared to those of a standard nonparametric estimation method that captures the empirical distribution function, and with models where tail events are modelled using Gaussian distribution and fractional Gaussian noise. The results suggest that the proposed parametric approach yields superior predictive performance. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","We show that VaR (Value-at-Risk) is not time-consistent and discuss examples where this can lead to dynamically inconsistent behavior.

Evaluation of volatility models is then considered and a simple Value-at-Risk (VaR) diagnostic test is proposed for individual as well as 'average' models. The asymptotic as well as the exact finite-sample distribution of the test statistic, dealing with the possibility of parameter uncertainty, are established. The model averaging idea and the VaR diagnostic tests are illustrated by an application to portfolios of daily returns on six currencies, four equity indices, four ten year government bonds and four commodities over the period 1991-2007. The empirical evidence supports the use of 'thick' model averaging strategies over single models or Bayesian type model averaging procedures. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed method is a two-step procedure, separating the estimation of the correlation structure from that of the univariate dynamics, thus facilitating the incorporation of non-Gaussian innovations distributions in a straightforward manner. The generalized hyperbolic distribution provides an excellent parametric description of financial returns data and is used for the univariate fits, but its convolutions, necessary for portfolio risk calculations, are intractable. This restriction is overcome by saddlepoint approximations for the Value at Risk and expected shortfall, which are computationally cheap and retain excellent accuracy far into the tails. It is further shown that the mean-expected shortfall portfolio optimization problem can be solved efficiently in the context of the model.

Such models are useful for measuring the risk of frequent small events, such as in internal risk management, but not for systemically important events. Unfortunately, it is common to see unrealistic demands placed on risk models. Having a number representing risk seems to be more important than having a number which is correct. Here, it is demonstrated that even in what may be the easiest and most reliable modeling exercise, value-at-risk forecasts from the most commonly used risk models provide very inconsistent results. © 2008.","Volatility prediction is the key variable in forecasting the prices of options, value-at-risk and, in general, the risk that investors face. By estimating not only inter-day volatility models that capture the main characteristics of asset returns, but also intra-day models, we were able to investigate their forecasting performance for three European equity indices. A consistent relation is shown between the examined models and the specific purpose of volatility forecasts.

We consider two nonparametric expected shortfall estimators for dependent financial losses. One is a sample average of excessive losses larger than a VaR. The other is a kernel smoothed version of the first estimator (Scaillet, 2004 Mathematical Finance), hoping that more accurate estimation can be achieved by smoothing. Our analysis reveals that the extra kernel smoothing does not produce more accurate estimation of the shortfall. This is different from the estimation of the VaR where smoothing has been shown to produce reduction in both the variance and the mean square error of estimation. Therefore, the simpler ES estimator based on the sample average of excessive losses is attractive for the shortfall estimation. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press.

An alternative estimator proposed in the paper is the Method of L-Moments estimator (MLM). The MLM estimator is consistent, but generally not fully efficient.

Conditional value-at-risk is estimated by inverting the weighted double kernel local linear estimate of the conditional distribution function. The nonparametric estimator of conditional expected shortfall is constructed by a plugging-in method. Both the asymptotic normality and consistency of the proposed nonparametric estimators are established at both boundary and interior points for time series data. We show that the weighted double kernel local linear conditional distribution estimator has the advantages of always being a distribution, continuous, and differentiable, besides the good properties from both the double kernel local linear and weighted Nadaraya-Watson estimators. Moreover, an ad hoc data-driven fashion bandwidth selection method is proposed, based on the nonparametric version of the Akaike information criterion. Finally, an empirical study is carried out to illustrate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators.","Estimation has been carried out using GARCH-type models, based on the Generalized Error Distribution (GED), for both the extreme downside and upside Value-at-Risks (VaR) of returns in the WTI and Brent crude oil spot markets. Furthermore, according to a new concept of Granger causality in risk, a kernel-based test is proposed to detect extreme risk spillover effect between the two oil markets. Results of an empirical study indicate that the GED-GARCH-based VaR approach appears more effective than the well-recognized HSAF (i.e. historical simulation with ARMA forecasts). Moreover, this approach is also more realistic and comprehensive than the standard normal distribution-based VaR model that is commonly used. Results reveal that there is significant two-way risk spillover effect between WTI and Brent markets. Supplementary study indicates that at the 99% confidence level, when negative market news arises that brings about a slump in oil price return, historical information on risk in the WTI market helps to forecast the Brent market. Conversely, it is not the case when positive news occurs and returns rise. Historical information on risk in the two markets can facilitate forecasts of future extreme market risks for each other. These results are valuable for anyone who needs evaluation and forecasts of the risk situation in international crude oil markets. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The performance of our MS model and single-regime models is compared through an innovative backtesting procedure using daily data for UK and US market stock indices. The findings from exceptions and regulatory-based tests indicate the MS-GARCH specifications clearly outperform other models in estimating the VaR for both long and short FTSE positions and also do quite well for S&amp;P positions. We conclude that ignoring skewness and regime changes has the effect of imposing larger than necessary conservative capital requirements. Copyright ©2008 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Energy Economics 25, 239-253] find that ARMA with historical simulation delivers VaR forecasts that are superior to those from GARCH. We compare the ARMA with historical simulation to the semi-parametric GARCH model proposed by Barone-Adesi et al. [Barone-Adesi, G., Giannopoulos, K., Vosper, L., 1999. VaR without correlations for portfolios of derivative securities. Journal of Futures Markets 19 (5), 583-602]. The results suggest that the semi-parametric GARCH model generates VaR forecasts that are superior to the VaR forecasts from the ARMA with historical simulation. This is due to the fact that GARCH captures volatility clustering. Our findings suggest that Cabedo and Moya's conclusion is mainly driven by the normal distributional assumption imposed on the future risk structure in the GARCH model.

It is found that four out of six US commercial banks have excessive trading risks. Monte Carlo simulation studies show that the proposed backtest is very accurate and powerful even for small test samples. More importantly, risk managers can carry out the proposed backtest based on any number of exceptions, so that incorrect risk models can be promptly detected before any further huge losses are realized. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the bias produced by volatility scaling is non-stationary in mean and standard deviation and its magnitude is likely influenced by monetary policy regime shifts. Moreover, while VaR is risk-coherence for elliptical distributions, this bias remains even for this class of distributions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Applying the SU-normal distribution to the estimation of univariate and multivariate GARCH models, we test its validity in capturing asymmetry and excess kurtosis of heteroscedastic asset returns. We find that the SU-normal distribution outperforms the normal and Student-t distributions for describing both the entire shape of the conditional distribution and the extreme tail shape of daily exchange rates and stock returns. The goodness-of-fit (GoF) results indicate that the skewness and excess kurtosis are better captured by the SU-normal distribution. The exceeding ratio (ER) test results indicate that the SU-normal is superior to the normal and Student-t distributions, which consistently underestimate both the lower and upper extreme tails, and tend to overestimate the lower tail in general. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The distributional differences found can be exploited to improve VaR calculations in several settings, giving rise to what we call 'MCVaR'. We compare the performance of MCVaR with unconditioned VaR calculation methods and with GARCH VaR by means of several back-testing techniques that take into account not only the number of violations but also their magnitude and clustering.","Accurate forecasting of risk is the key to successful risk management techniques. Using the largest stock index futures from 12 European bourses, this paper presents VaR measures based on their unconditional and conditional distributions for single and multi-period settings. These measures underpinned by extreme value theory are statistically robust explicitly allowing for fat-tailed densities. Conditional tail estimates accounting for volatility clustering are obtained by adjusting the unconditional extreme value procedure with GARCH filtered returns. The conditional modelling results in iid returns allowing for the use of a simple and efficient multi-period extreme value scaling law. The paper examines the properties of these distinct conditional and unconditional trading models. The paper finds that the biases inherent in unconditional single and multi-period estimates assuming normality extend to the conditional setting. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Three main results are obtained. First, portfolios on the VaR-constrained boundary exhibit (K + 2)-fund separation, where K is the number of states for which the portfolios suffer losses equal to the VaR bound. Second, portfolios on the CVaR-constrained boundary exhibit (K + 3)-fund separation, where K is the number of states for which the portfolios suffer losses equal to their VaRs. Third, an example illustrates that while the VaR of the CVaR-constrained optimal portfolio is close to that of the VaR-constrained optimal portfolio, the CVaR of the former is notably smaller than that of the latter. This result suggests that a CVaR constraint is more effective than a VaR constraint to curtail large losses in the mean-variance model. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These techniques could revolutionise banks' management of credit risk and could in the longer term serve as a more risk-sensitive basis for calculating regulatory capital on banks' loan books than in Basel 2, the new regulatory capital framework. In this paper we implement a popular credit risk model that exploits the information in credit ratings to determine a portfolio's value-at-risk.

We examine whether the quantitative value-at-risk (VAR) estimates disclosed by 81 non-financial firms during the period 1997-2002 are value-relevant using the earnings-returns relation. The empirical results indicate that high VAR is associated with weaker earnings-returns relation. Further analysis shows that VAR is positively and significantly associated with future stock return volatility. Our evidence suggests that investors perceive the earnings of firms with substantial market risk exposure to be less persistent, and adjust the future abnormal earnings for the higher risk exposure. Thus, this results in a lower expected rate of return. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","A new class of asymmetric loss functions derived from the least absolute deviations or least squares loss with a constraint on the mean of one tail of the residual error distribution, is introduced for analyzing financial data. Motivated by risk management principles, the primary intent is to provide \"cautious\" forecasts under uncertainty. The net effect on fitted models is to shape the residuals so that on average only a prespecified proportion of predictions tend to fall above or below a desired threshold. The loss functions are reformulated as objective functions in the context of parameter estimation for linear regression models, and it is demonstrated how optimization can be implemented via linear programming. The method is a competitor of quantile regression, but is more flexible and broader in scope. An application is illustrated on prediction of NDX and SPX index returns data, while controlling the magnitude of a fraction of worst losses. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This approach has been designed specifically for use within the hedge fund-of-funds environment, but is equally relevant to those who seek to construct risk-managed portfolios of hedge funds under less than perfect underlying portfolio transparency. Using dynamic multivariate regression analysis coupled with a qualitative understanding of hedge fund return drivers, one is able to perform a robust factor decomposition to attribute risk within any hedge fund portfolio with an identifiable strategy. Furthermore, through use of Monte Carlo simulation techniques, these factors can be employed to generate implied risk profiles at either the constituent fund or aggregate fund-of-funds level. As well as being pertinent to risk forecasting and monitoring, such methods also have application to style analysis, profit attribution, portfolio stress testing and diversification studies. This paper outlines such a framework and presents sample results in each of these areas.","This paper critiques the revised Basel II capital requirements for banks. To provide a framework for analysis, the XYZ theory of regulatory capital is formulated. Independent of the XYZ theory, we argue that the revised Basel II capital rule for credit risk is not a good approximation to the ideal rule. Based on this, and using the XYZ theory, we argue that: (1) the revised Basel II rules should not replace the existing approaches for determining minimal capital standards, but should be used in conjunction with them, and (2) that calibrating the capital rules to maintain aggregate market capital is a prudent procedure. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Recent results in value at risk analysis show that, for extremely heavy-tailed risks with unbounded distribution support, diversification may increase value at risk, and that generally it is difficult to construct an appropriate risk measure for such distributions. We further analyze the limitations of diversification for heavy-tailed risks. We provide additional insight in two ways. First, we show that similar non-diversification results are valid for a large class of risks with bounded support, as long as the risks are concentrated on a sufficiently large interval. The required length of the support depends on the number of risks available and on the degree of heavy-tailedness. Second, we relate the value at risk approach to more general risk frameworks. We argue that in markets for risky assets where the number of assets is limited compared with the (bounded) distribution support of the risks, unbounded heavy-tailed risks may provide a reasonable approximation. We suggest that this type of analysis may have a role in explaining various types of market failures in markets for assets with possibly large negative outcomes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In such a context this paper shows that EVA and RAROC based capital budgeting mechanisms have economic foundations. We derive optimal capital allocation under asymmetric information and in the presence of outside managerial opportunities for an institution with a risky and a riskless division. It is shown that the results extend in a consistent manner to the multidivisional case of decentralized investment decisions with a suitable redefinition of economic capital. The decentralization leads to a charge for economic capital based on the division's own realized risk. Outside managerial opportunities increase the usage of capital and lead to overinvestment in risky projects; at the same time more capital is raised but risk limits are binding in more states. An institution with a single risky division should base its hurdle rate for capital allocated on the cost of debt. In contrast, the hurdle rate tends to the cost of equity for a diversified multidivisional firm. The analysis shows that hurdle rates have a common component in contrast to the standard perfect markets result with division-specific hurdle rates. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Innovative aspects of this paper include (i) a wide set of distributions considered, (ii) L-moment diagrams employed to identify the most appropriate distribution/s, (iii) 'probability weighted moments' used to estimate the parameters of these distribution/s and (iv) the Anderson-Darling goodness of fit test employed to test the adequacy of fit. The 'generalized logistic' distribution is found to provide adequate descriptions of the extreme minima of the German stock market over the period studied.

With VaR-CR regulation the agent strategy consists of simultaneous decisions on both the portfolio VaR and on the implied amount of required eligible capital. As a result, the performance of VaR-CR regulation depends on its design (the parameter n) and the agent preferences. We show that an optimal VaR-CR regulation allows the regulator on the one hand, to completely eliminate the exposure to the largest losses, which may jeopardize the existence of the institution, and on the other hand, to restrain the portfolio exposure to all other losses. These results rationalize the current Basel regulations. However, the analysis shows also that there is an optimal level of required eligible capital from the regulator standpoint. Counter-intuitively, any requirement above this optimal level is inefficient as it leads to a smaller amount of actually maintained eligible capital and thereby to a larger exposure to the most adverse states of the world. Unfortunately, the current Basel's range of required levels (n = 3-4) is within this inefficient range. Moreover, with an inefficient regulation the agent might employ an inefficient reporting and disclosure procedure. © 2007.","Assumptions about the dynamic and distributional behavior of risk factors are crucial for the construction of optimal portfolios and for risk assessment. Although asset returns are generally characterized by conditionally varying volatilities and fat tails, the normal distribution with constant variance continues to be the standard framework in portfolio management. Here we propose a practical approach to portfolio selection. It takes both the conditionally varying volatility and the fat-tailedness of risk factors explicitly into account, while retaining analytical tractability and ease of implementation. An application to a portfolio of nine German DAX stocks illustrates that the model is strongly favored by the data and that it is practically implementable. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.","Using two large hedge fund databases, this paper empirically tests the presence and significance of a cross-sectional relation between hedge fund returns and value at risk (VaR). The univariate and bivariate portfolio-level analyses as well as the fund-level regression results indicate a significantly positive relation between VaR and the cross-section of expected returns on live funds. During the period of January 1995 to December 2003, the live funds with high VaR outperform those with low VaR by an annual return difference of 9%. This risk-return tradeoff holds even after controlling for age, size, and liquidity factors. Furthermore, the risk profile of defunct funds is found to be different from that of live funds. The relation between downside risk and expected return is found to be negative for defunct funds because taking high risk by these funds can wipe out fund capital, and hence they become defunct. Meanwhile, voluntary closure makes some well performed funds with large assets and low risk fall into the defunct category. Hence, the risk-return relation for defunct funds is more complicated than what implies by survival. We demonstrate how to distinguish live funds from defunct funds on an ex ante basis. A trading rule based on buying the expected to live funds and selling the expected to disappear funds provides an annual profit of 8-10% depending on the investment horizons. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence of cyclical components in both the catastrophic and operational risk measures obtained from the generalized Pareto distribution and the skewed generalized error distribution. Our new, comprehensive approach to measuring operational risk shows that approximately 18% of financial institutions' returns represent compensation for operational risk. However, depository institutions are exposed to operational risk levels that average 39% of the overall equity risk premium. Moreover, operational risk events are more likely to be the cause of large unexpected catastrophic losses, although when they occur, the losses are smaller than those resulting from a combination of market risk, credit risk or other risk events. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Considering a GARCH model with heavy-tailed innovations, we characterize the limiting distribution of an estimator of the conditional value-at-risk (VaR), which corresponds to the extremal quantile of the conditional distribution of the GARCH process. We propose two methods, the normal approximation method and the data tilting method, for constructing confidence intervals for the conditional VaR estimator and assess their accuracies by simulation studies.

We elaborate a formula for determining the optimal strike price for this put option in case of a Vasicek stochastic interest rate model. We demonstrate the relevance of searching the optimal strike price, since moving away from the optimum implies a loss, either due to an increased VaR or due to an increased hedging expenditure. In this way, we extend the results of [Ahn, Boudoukh, Richardson, and Whitelaw (1999). Journal of Finance, 54, 359-375] who minimize VaR for a position in a share.

Specifically, VaR is calculated for large and small capitalization stocks, based on Dow Jones (DJ) Euro Stoxx indices and is modeled for long and short trading positions by using non parametric, semi parametric and parametric methods. In order to choose one model among the various forecasting methods, a two-stage backtesting procedure is implemented. In the first stage the unconditional coverage test is used to examine the statistical accuracy of the models. In the second stage a loss function is applied to investigate whether the differences between the models, that calculated accurately the VaR, are statistically significant. Under this framework, the combination of a parametric model with the historical simulation produced robust results across the sample periods, market capitalization schemes, trading positions and confidence levels and therefore there is a risk measure that is reliable. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","This paper examines the economic value of overnight information to users of risk management models. In addition to the information revealed by overseas markets that trade during the (domestic) overnight period, this paper exploits information generated via recent innovations in the structure of financial markets. In particular, certain securities (and associated derivative products) can now be traded at any time over a 24-h period. As such, it is now possible to make use of information generated by trading, in (almost) identical securities, during the overnight period. Of the securities that are available over such time periods, S&amp;P 500 related products are by far the most actively traded and are, therefore, the subject of this paper. Using a variety of conditional volatility models that allow time-dependent information flow within (and across) three different S&amp;P 500 markets, the results show that overnight information flow has a significant impact on the conditional volatility of daytime traded S&amp;P 500 securities. Moreover (time-consistent) forecasts from models that incorporate overnight information are shown to have economic value to risk managers. In particular, Value-at-Risk (VaR) models based on these conditional volatility models are shown to be more accurate than VaR models that ignore overnight information. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal hedging level, which depends on individual preferences, is regarded as a measure of risk. We determine the set of optimal levels and investigate the properties of the associated risk measures. This approach provides a new insight into Value at Risk (VaR). We consider it as a solution of a certain optimal inventory problem with linear cost and loss functions. We show that these functions determine the confidence level of VaR. In this way we obtain a simple model that helps us to choose a proper confidence level α and explains why supervisory institutions (such as the Basle Committee) choose a higher α than financial institutions themselves.","This paper applies the extreme-value (EV) generalised pareto distribution to the extreme tails of the return distributions for the S&amp;P500, FT100, DAX, Hang Seng, and Nikkei225 futures contracts. It then uses tail estimators from these contracts to estimate spectral risk measures, which are coherent risk measures that reflect a user's risk-aversion function. It compares these to VaR and expected shortfall (ES) risk measures, and compares the precision of their estimators. It also discusses the usefulness of these risk measures in the context of clearinghouses setting initial margin requirements, and compares these to the SPAN measures typically used. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Using an omnibus nonparametric procedure for density forecast evaluation in a continuous-time framework, we provide probably the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the out-of-sample performance of ATSMs in forecasting the joint conditional probability density of bond yields. We find that although the random walk models tend to have better forecasts for the conditional mean dynamics of bond yields, some ATSMs provide better forecasts for the joint probability density of bond yields. However, all ATSMs considered are still overwhelmingly rejected by our tests and fail to provide satisfactory density forecasts. There exists room for further improving density forecasts for bond yields by extending ATSMs. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For non-seasonal commodities-such as crude oil-the forward curve is well described by the first three principal components: the level, slope and curvature. A principal component indicator is described that detects transitions between the two fundamental market states remarkably well. For seasonal commodities-such as electricity and natural gas-it is shown how to extract the seasonal component from the forward curve. The principal component indicator can then be applied to the de-seasoned forward curve to detect significant price deviations that may support profitable trading strategies.

The model proposed and considered here combines features of the classical factor model with that of the heavy tailed univariate stochastic volatility model. A unified analysis of the model, and its special cases, is developed that encompasses estimation, filtering and model choice. The centerpieces of the estimation algorithm (which relies on MCMC methods) are: (1) a reduced blocking scheme for sampling the free elements of the loading matrix and the factors and (2) a special method for sampling the parameters of the univariate SV process. The resulting algorithm is scalable in terms of series and factors and simulation-efficient. Methods for estimating the log-likelihood function and the filtered values of the time-varying volatilities and correlations are also provided. The performance and effectiveness of the inferential methods are extensively tested using simulated data where models up to 50 dimensions and 688 parameters are fit and studied. The performance of our model, in relation to various multivariate GARCH models, is also evaluated using a real data set of weekly returns on a set of 10 international stock indices. We consider the performance along two dimensions: the ability to correctly estimate the conditional covariance matrix of future returns and the unconditional and conditional coverage of the 5% and 1% value-at-risk (VaR) measures of four pre-defined portfolios. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A common method for this purpose is the square-root-of-time rule where an estimated quantile of a return distribution is scaled to a lower frequency by the square root of the time horizon. This paper examines time scaling of quantiles when returns follow a jump diffusion process. We demonstrate that when jumps represent losses, the square-root-of-time rule leads to a systematic underestimation of risk, whereby the degree of underestimation worsens with the time horizon, the jump intensity and the confidence level. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Price limits cause stock returns to be restricted within a prespecified range whereas infrequent trading induces spurious autocorrelation and biased estimate of the return variance. Both factors cause traditional measures of Value at Risk (VaR) to be biased. In this paper, we propose VaR measures based on a two-limit type Tobit model incorporating Scholes and Williams' [Scholes, M., &amp; Williams, J. (1977). Estimating betas from nonsynchronous data, Journal of Financial Economics 5, 309-328] estimator that adjusts for price limits and nonsynchronous trading. Based on the simulation design of Brown and Warner [Brown, S., &amp; Warner, J. (1985). Measuring security price performance, Journal of Financial Economics 8, 205-258], we compare the performance of our proposed methods with two traditional methods, one based on naive OLS estimates and the other based on historical simulation. Using daily data of all stocks listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the OTC markets, the simulation results indicate that all methods perform reasonably well. The only exception is that the naive OLS yields a slightly higher failure rate when the portfolio under consideration is composed of only a few stocks. Thus, despite the potential problems induced by nonsynchronous trading and price limits, their practical impacts seem limited. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

One important application of our model is economic capital (EC) and a concept of EC based on the analogy with classical risk theory is introduced and the questions of allocation as well as risk-adjusted pricing based on the allocation of EC are structured and described.

This paper uses several different univariate and multivariate statistical models to estimate forecasts of daily volatility in petroleum futures price returns. The out-of-sample forecasts are evaluated using forecast accuracy tests and market timing tests. The TGARCH model fits well for heating oil and natural gas volatility and the GARCH model fits well for crude oil and unleaded gasoline volatility. Simple moving average models seem to fit well in some cases provided the correct order is chosen. Despite the increased complexity, models like state space, vector autoregression and bivariate GARCH do not perform as well as the single equation GARCH model. Most models out perform a random walk and there is evidence of market timing. Parametric and non-parametric value at risk measures are calculated and compared. Non-parametric models outperform the parametric models in terms of number of exceedences in backtests. These results are useful for anyone needing forecasts of petroleum futures volatility. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An important property of our work is that the size of our data set allows us to derive measures of credit risk without making any assumptions about correlations between loans, by applying Carey's [Carey, Mark, 1998. Credit risk in private debt portfolios. Journal of Finance LIII (4), 1363-1387] non-parametric Monte Carlo re-sampling method. We find substantial differences between the implied loss distributions of two banks with equal \"regulatory\" risk profiles; both expected losses and the credit loss rates at a wide range of loss distribution percentiles vary considerably. Such variation will translate into different levels of required economic capital. Our results also confirm the quantitative importance of size for portfolio credit risk: for common parameter values, we find that tail risk can be reduced by up to 40% by doubling portfolio size. Our analysis makes clear that not only the formal design of a rating system, but also the way in which it is implemented (e.g. a rating grade composition; the degree of homogeneity within rating classes) can be quantitatively important for the shape of credit loss distributions and thus for banks' required capital structure. The evidence of differences between lenders also hints at the presence of differentiated market equilibria, that are more complex than might otherwise be supposed: different lending or risk management \"styles\" may emerge and banks strike their own balance between risk-taking and (the cost of) monitoring (that risk). © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Accordingly, we consider the simultaneous choice of an optimal dynamic reporting and investment strategy. Overall, we find that VaR-based capital requirements can be very effective not only in curbing portfolio risk but also in inducing revelation of this risk. © 2005.","Value at Risk has lost the battle against Expected Shortfall on theoretical grounds, the latter satisfying all coherence properties while the former may, on carefully constructed cases, lack the sub-additivity property that is in a sense, the most important property a risk measure ought to satisfy. While the superiority of Expected Shortfall is evident as a theoretical tool, little has been researched on the properties of estimators proposed in the literature. Since those estimators are the real tools for calculating bank capital reserves in practice, the natural question that one may ask is whether a given estimator of Expected Shortfall also satisfies the coherence properties. In this paper, we show that it is possible to have estimators of Expected Shortfall that do not satisfy the sub-additivity condition. This finding should motivate risk managers and quantitative asset managers to investigate further the properties of the estimators of the risk measures they are currently utilizing.","This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of macro stress-testing methodologies. We assess the progress made both in the econometric analysis of balance sheet indicators and in the simulation of value-at-risk measures to assess system-wide vulnerabilities. To illustrate the main analytical approaches in the literature, we estimate two different models for stress-testing purposes using data for Finland over the time period from 1986 to 2003. The Finnish experience in the early 1990s appears particularly suited for macro stress-testing as it includes a severe recession with significantly higher-than-average default rates and banks' loan losses. We highlight a number of methodological challenges that still remain concerning in particular the correlation of market and credit risks over time and across institutions, the limited time horizon generally used for macro stress-testing and the potential instability of reduced-form parameter estimates because of feedback effects. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We specify and fit a number of models of the implied volatility surface and find that it has a rich and interesting structure that strongly departs from a constant volatility, Black-Scholes benchmark. This result is robust to alternative econometric approaches, including generalized least squares approaches that take into account both the panel structure of the data and the likely presence of heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in the random disturbances. Finally we show that the degree of pricing efficiency of this options market can strongly condition the results of the econometric analysis and therefore our understanding of the pricing mechanism underlying observed MIBO option prices.

For normal distributions the censored mean is synonymous with the statistical hazard function, but this is not true for fat-tailed distributions. The latter turn out to imply much tighter bounds for the admissible portfolio sel and indeed for the logistic, an upper bound for the portfolio variance that yields a simple portfolio choice rule. The choice theory in GVaR is in general not consistent with classic Von Neumann-Morgenslern utility functions for money. A re-specification is suggested to make it so that gives a clearer picture of the economic role of the respective constraints. This can be used analytically to explore the choice of portfolio hedges.","We discuss the application of gradient methods to calibrate mean reverting stochastic volatility models. For this we use formulas based on Girsanov transformations as well as a modification of the Bismut-EKvorthy formula lo compute the derivatives of certain option prices with respect lo the parameters of the model by applying Monte Carlo methods.

The analysis is based on a Kalman filter estimation of a two-factor affine model which specifies the yield curve dynamics. We then apply a broad class of copula functions for modeling dependence in factors spanning the yield curve. Our sample of monthly yields in the 1982-2001 period provides evidence of upper tail dependence in yield innovations; i.e., large positive interest rate shocks tend to occur under increased dependence. In contrast, the best-fitting copula model coincides with zero lower tail dependence. This asymmetry has substantial risk management implications. We give an example in estimating bond portfolio loss quantiles and report the biases which result from an application of the normal dependence model. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This motivates a bivariate extension of the Markov-Switching Multifractal (MSM) introduced in Calvet and Fisher (J. Econ. 105 (2001) 27, J. Financ. Econ. 2 (2004) 49). Bivariate MSM is a stochastic volatility model with a closed-form likelihood. Estimation can proceed by maximum likelihood for state spaces of moderate size, and by simulated likelihood via a particle filter in high-dimensional cases. We estimate the model and confirm its main assumptions in likelihood ratio tests. Bivariate MSM compares favorably to a standard multivariate GARCH both in- and out-of-sample. A parsimonious multifrequency factor structure is finally proposed for multivariate settings with potentially many assets. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Such measures, derived for example from conditional value-at-risk and its variants, can reflect the different attitudes of different classes of investors. They lead nonetheless to generalized one-fund theorems in which a more customized version of portfolio optimization is the aim, rather than the idea that a single \"master fund\" might arise from market equilibrium and serve the interests of all investors. The results that are obtained cover discrete distributions along with continuous distributions. They are applicable therefore to portfolios involving derivatives, which create jumps in distribution functions at specific gain or loss values, well as to financial models involving finitely many scenarios. Furthermore, they deal rigorously with issues that come up at that level of generality, but have not received adequate attention, including possible lack of differentiability to th deviation expression with respect to the portfolio weights, and the potential nonuniqueness of optimal weights. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This paper theoretically and empirically examines the historical simulation method, a variant of historical simulation introduced by Boudoukh et al. [Boudoukh, J., Richardson, M., Whitelaw, R., 1998. The best of both worlds, Risk 11(May) 64-67] (BRW), and the filtered historical simulation method (FHS) of Barone-Adesi et al. [Barone-Adesi, G., Bourgoin F., Giannopoulos, K., 1998. Don't look back.

The historical simulation and BRW methods are both under-responsive to changes in conditional risk; and respond to changes in risk in an asymmetric fashion: measured risk increases when the portfolio experiences large losses, but not when it earns large gains. The FHS method is promising, but its risk estimates are variable in small samples, and its assumption that correlations are constant is violated in large samples. Additional refinements are needed to account for time-varying correlations; and to choose the appropriate length of the historical sample period. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In particular a GARCH(1,1) model, an EGARCH(1,1) model and a log-normal AR(1) stochastic volatility model are considered. The three models are estimated on UK stock data: a series of the British equity index FTSE100 is used to estimate the relevant parameters. Diagnostic tests are implemented to evaluate how well the models fit the data. The models are used to obtain daily volatility forecasts and these volatilities are used to estimate the \"VaR on a simple one-unit position on FTSE100. The VaR accuracy is tested by means of a backtest. While the results do not lead to a straightforward preference between GARCH(1,1) and SV, the EGARCH shows the best performance.","This comment discusses some errors in [Journal of Banking and Finance 25 (2001) 1789]. Given the portfolio rate of return is normally distributed, the following can be inferred. First, taking expected portfolio return rate as the benchmark of value-at-risk (VaR), the risk-return ratio collapses to a multiple of the Sharpe index. However, using risk-free rate as the benchmark, then above inference does not hold. Second, whether the benchmark of VaR is expected portfolio return rate or the risk-free rate, the optimal asset allocations for maximizing the risk-return ratio and Sharpe index are identical. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

How should portfolio managers choose among the large number of covariance forecasting models available? We find that covariance matrix forecasts generated by models incorporating interest-rate level volatility effects perform best with respect to statistical loss functions. However, within a value-at-risk (VaR) framework, the relative performance of the covariance matrix forecasts depends greatly on the VaR distributional assumption, and forecasts based just on weighted averages of past observations perform best. In addition, portfolio variance forecasts that ignore the covariance matrix generate the lowest regulatory capital charge, a key economic decision variable for commercial banks. Our results provide empirical support for the commonly used VaR models based on simple covariance matrix forecasts and distributional assumptions. © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.","Risk managers use portfolios to diversify away the unpriced risk of individual securities. In this article we compare the benefits of portfolio diversification for downside risk in case returns are normally distributed with the case of fat-tailed distributed returns. The downside risk of a security is decomposed into a part which is attributable to the market risk, an idiosyncratic part, and a second independent factor. We show that the fat-tailed-based downside risk, measured as value-at-risk (VaR), should decline more rapidly than the normal-based VaR.

Most research on this issue has been based on parameterized credit risk models. We present new evidence by applying Carey's (Carey, Mark. \"Credit Risk in Private Debt Portfolios.\" Journal of Finance 53, no. 4 (1998), 1363-1387.) nonparametric Monte-Carlo resampling method to two banks' complete loan portfolios. By exploiting that a sub-sample of all borrowers has been assigned an internal rating by both banks, we can compare the credit loss distributions for the three credit types, and compute both economic and regulatory capital under Basel II. We also test if our conclusions are sensitive to the definitions of R&amp;SME credit. Our findings show that R&amp;SME portfolios are usually riskier than corporate credit. Special treatment under Basel II is thus not justified. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","We propose an encompassing test for comparing conditional quantile forecasts in an out-of-sample frame-work. Our test provides a basis for forecast combination when encompassing is rejected. Its central features are (1) use of the \"tick\" loss function, (2) a conditional approach to out-of-sample evaluation, and (3) derivation in an environment with asymptotically nonvanishing estimation uncertainty. Our approach is valid under general conditions; the forecasts can be based on nested or nonnested models and can be obtained by general estimation procedures.

Our analysis shows that it is important to take into account parameter uncertainty, since this leads to uncertainty in the predicted VaR. We make this uncertainty in the VaR explicit by means of simulation. Our empirical results suggest that more sophisticated tail-modeling approaches come at the cost of more uncertainty about the VaR-estimate itself. We show how to adjust VaR calculations in order to take the parameter uncertainty into account. This is accomplished through a data-driven method to deliver not just a point estimate of the VaR, but a region. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We take a novel approach by arguing that the risk management problem faced by the FDIC is similar to that of a bank managing a loan portfolio, only in the FDIC's case the risk arises from the potential for loss of the individual banks in its portfolio. We explicitly estimate the cumulative loss distribution of FDIC insured banks using two variations of the Merton model and find that reserves are sufficient to cover roughly 99.85% of the loss distribution, corresponding to about a BBB+ rating. However, under different stress scenarios (higher correlations, fat-tailed bank returns, increased loss severity) that level can be much lower: approximately 96% corresponding to about a B+ rating. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","In this paper, market risk at an intraday time horizon is quantified using normal GARCH, Student GARCH, RiskMetrics and high-frequency duration (log-ACD) models set in the framework of the conditional VaR methodology. Because of the small time horizon of the intraday returns (15 and 30 minute returns in this paper), an evaluation of intraday market risk can be useful to market participants (traders, market makers) involved in frequent trading. As expected, the volatility features an important intraday seasonality, which must be removed prior to using the market risk models. The four models are applied to intraday returns data for three stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and it is shown that the Student GARCH model performs best. The use of price durations as a measure of risk on time is commented upon. © 2005 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Capital allocation techniques are of central importance in portfolio management and risk-based performance measurement. In this paper we propose an axiom system for capital allocation and analyze its satisfiability and completeness: it is shown that for a given risk measure ρ there exists a capital allocation Λ ρ that satisfies the main axioms if and only if ρ is subadditive and positively homogeneous. Furthermore, it is proved that the axiom system uniquely specifies Λ ρ. We apply the axiomatization to the most popular risk measures in the finance industry in order to derive explicit capital allocation formulae for these measures. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Inc.,.","We propose a practical and flexible method to introduce skewness in multivariate symmetric distributions.

Using extensive data on nearly 1,500 hedge funds, we find only 3.7% live and 10.9% dead funds are undercapitalized as of March 2003. Moreover, the undercapitalized funds are relatively small and constitute a tiny fraction of total fund assets in our sample. Cross-sectionally, the variability in fund capitalization is related to size, investment style, age, and management fee. Hedge fund risk and capitalization also display significant time variation. Traditional risk measures like standard deviation or leverage ratios fail to detect these trends. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Special emphasis is paid on two methodologies related to the Extreme Value Theory (EVT): the Peaks over Threshold (POT) and the Blocks Maxima (BM). Both estimation techniques are based on limit results for the excess distribution over high thresholds and block maxima, respectively. They are applied on, USD-denominated, daily returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) indices with the intension to compare the performance of the various estimation techniques on markets with different capitalization and trading practices.

Unfortunately the use of classical multivariate methods in large dimensions is difficult because of the curse of dimensionality. We present a general semiparametric technique, based on functional gradient descent (FGD) and able to overcome most problems associated with a multivariate GARCH-type estimation. By testing the accuracy of the volatility estimates for the measurement of market risk on real data we provide empirical evidence of the strong predictive potential of the FGD approach, also in comparison to other standard methods. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Among these problems, an important one is that VaR disregards any loss beyond the VaR level. We call this problem the \"tail risk\". In this paper, we illustrate how the tail risk of VaR can cause serious problems in certain cases, cases in which expected shortfall can serve more aptly in its place. We discuss two cases: concentrated credit portfolio and foreign exchange rates under market stress. We show that expected shortfall requires a larger sample size than VaR to provide the same level of accuracy. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

As a particular case, we examine a simple Gaussian example in order to illustrate the impact of netting agreements in credit risk management. Collateral issues are also dealt with. For practical purposes we further provide nonparametric estimators for sensitivities and derive their asymptotic distributions.

Second, tail dependence of paired returns decreases substantially when both heteroscedasticity and serial correlation are filtered out by a multivariate GARCH model. Both findings are in agreement with previous research in this area for other financial markets. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The generalised term uncertainty is understood to have two aspects: risk modelled by probability (stochastic methodology) and vagueness sometimes called impreciseness, ambiguity, softness is modelled by fuzzy methodology. Thus, hybrid model is called fuzzy-stochastic model. Input data for a stochastic model are unique distribution functions and crisp (real) data. Input data for fuzzy model are fuzzy numbers and crisp (real) data. Input data for hybrid model are fuzzy probability distribution functions, unique distribution functions, and crisp (real) data. Softly defined VAR model is constructed as hybrid model because it is supposed that the input data are difficult to determine as crisp numbers or as some unique distribution functions. Risk is modelled by stochastic methodology on the VAR basis and vagueness is modelled through the fuzzy numbers. The analytical delta normal VAR methodology for international index portfolio under soft conditions is described including illustrative example. It is shown, that methodology described could be considered to be generalised sensitivity analysis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This is typically the situation for portfolios including derivatives. In this case, it can be necessary to come back to the basic expected utility approach. In this paper, an efficient portfolio maximizes the expected utility of future wealth. This paper presents an analysis of the efficiency frontier, formed by a set of efficient portfolios corresponding to a parameterized class of utility functions. First, we discuss the estimation of an efficient portfolio and introduce several tests of the efficiency hypothesis, depending on what is known about the utility function and the budget level. Next we analyse the shape of the frontier and develop a procedure for testing the separability of the efficiency frontier into K independent funds. The inference is semi-nonparametric because the return distribution is left unspecified.

The worst conditional expectation of the shortfall is adopted as the measure of this risk, ensuring that the minimized risk satisfies certain desirable properties as the dynamic measure of risk, as proposed by Cvitanić and Karatzas (1999). The terminal value of the optimized portfolio is a binary functional dependent on F and the Radon-Nikodym density of the equivalent local martingale measure. In particular, it is observed that there exists a positive number x* that is less than the replicating cost X F of F, and that the strategy minimizing the expectation of the shortfall is optimal if the hedger's capital is in the range [x*, x f].","This paper presents a new approach to modeling the dynamics of implied distributions. First, we obtain a parsimonious description of the dynamics of the S&amp;P 500 implied cumulative distribution functions by applying principal components analysis. Subsequently, we develop new arbitrage-free Monte Carlo simulation methods that model the evolution of the whole distribution through time as a diffusion process. Our approach generalizes the conventional approaches of modeling only the first two moments as diffusion processes, and it has important implications for \"smile-consistent\" option pricing and for risk management.

The solution to the infinite-horizon stochastic optimization problem is related to period-by-period value at risk (var) in which the optimal probability of failure is endogenously determined. Over a cycle, var is positively correlated with optimal flows of external capital, but negatively correlated with optimal net changes in capital and the optimal level of total capital. Analysis of this pattern suggests that a regulatory minimum requirement based on var, if binding, is likely to be procyclical. The model points to several ways of reducing this problem. For example, a var-based requirement makes more sense if it is applied to external capital flows than if it is applied to the total level of capital. US commercial bank data since 1984 are generally consistent with the model. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

While the VaR specification based on a long memory skewed Student model for the daily realized volatility provides adequate 1-day-ahead VaR forecasts for two stock indexes (the CAC40 and SP500) and two exchange rate returns (the YEN-USD and DEM-USD), it does not really improve on the performance of a VaR model based on the skewed Student APARCH model and estimated using daily data only. Thus both methods seem to be equivalent. This paper also shows that daily returns standardized by the square root of the 1-day-ahead forecast of the daily realized volatility are not normally distributed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This assumption fails to take into account the feedback effect of trading decisions on prices. We investigate the consequences of risk constrained trading by means of simulations of a general equilibrium model with a value-at-risk constraint and compare the results to the case when risk constraints are not present.

In this paper we propose a generalization to the popular RiskMetrics approach to Value-at-Risk. In order to model scale-consistent Value-at-Risk (VaR), we propose a model with a time varying scale parameter and error terms that are truncated Lévy distributed. Lévy flights include a method for scaling up from a single-day volatility to a multi-day volatility. We use this rule to approximate future volatility and estimate Value-at-Risk several days ahead, and compare it to the popular approach, which is a special case of our method. Back-testing results suggest that the inclusion of more sophisticated tail properties and the data-driven scaling rule improves the performance of the VaR model significantly, for short and long time horizons.

We explore and compare two different possible sources of performance improvements: asymmetry in the conditional variance and fat-tailed distributions. Performance is assessed using a range of measures that address the accuracy and efficiency of each model. The TAIFEX and SGX-DT Taiwan stock index futures are studied using daily data. Our results suggest that for asset returns which exhibit fatter tails and volatility clustering, like the TAIFEX and SGX-DT futures, the VaR values produced by the Normal APARCH model are preferred at lower confidence levels. However, at high confidence levels, the VaR forecasts obtained by the Student APARCH model are more accurate than those generated using either the RiskMetrics or Normal APARCH models.","Multinational companies face increasing risks arising from external risk factors, e.g. exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which they have learned to hedge using derivatives. However, despite increasing disclosure requirements, a firm’s net risk profile may not be transparent to shareholders. We develop the ‘Component Value-at-Risk (VaR)’ framework for companies to identify the multi-dimensional downside risk profile as perceived by shareholders. This framework allows for decomposing downside risk into components that are attributable to each of the underlying risk factors. The firm can compare this perceived VaR, including its composition and dynamics, to an internal VaR based on net exposures as it is known to the company. Any differences may lead to surprises at times of earnings announcements and thus constitute a litigation threat to the firm. It may reduce this information asymmetry through targeted communication efforts. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Financial risk management typically deals with low-probability events in the tails of asset price distributions. To capture the behavior of these tails, one should therefore rely on models that explicitly focus on the tails. Extreme value theory (EVT)-based models do exactly that, and in this paper, we apply both unconditional and conditional EVT models to the management of extreme market risks in stock markets. We find conditional EVT models to give particularly accurate Value-at-Risk (VaR) measures, and a comparison with traditional (Generalized ARCH (GARCH)) approaches to calculate VaR demonstrates EVT as being the superior approach both for standard and more extreme VaR quantiles. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

While the skewed Student APARCH model performs best in all cases, the skewed Student ARCH model delivers good results and its estimation does not require non-linear optimization procedures. As such this new model could be relatively easily integrated in a spreadsheet-like environment and used by market practitioners. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We analyze the fluctuations of the maximal and minimal changes in short-term interest rates and test the significance of time-varying paths followed by the mean and volatility of extremes. We formally determine the relevance of introducing trend and serial correlation in the mean and of incorporating the level and GARCH effects in the volatility of extreme changes in the federal funds rate. The empirical findings indicate the existence of volatility clustering in the standard deviation of extremes and a significantly positive relationship between the level and the volatility of extremes. The results point to the presence of an autoregressive process in the means of both local maxima and local minima values. The paper proposes a conditional extreme value approach to calculating value at risk (VaR) by specifying the location and scale parameters of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) as a function of past information.

For example, it offers a new attractive estimation method for such important semi-parametric problems as censored and instrumental quantile regression, nonlinear GMM and value-at-risk models. The LTEs are computed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which help circumvent the computational curse of dimensionality.

Assumptions about input quality are derived from the distribution of historical sample statistics commonly used in default risk modelling. The resulting estimation error in the distribution of portfolio losses is considerable. Losses that are judged to occur with a probability of 0.3% may actually occur with a probability of 1%. The paper also shows that estimation error leads to biases in value at risk estimates and significance levels of backtests. The biases can be corrected by analysing predictive distributions which average over the unknown parameter values. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

VaR provides an estimation for the maximum oil price change associated with a likelihood level, and can be used for designing risk management strategies. We analyse three VaR calculation methods: The historical simulation standard approach, the historical simulation with ARMA forecasts (HSAF) approach, developed in this paper, and the variance-covariance method based on autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models forecasts. The results obtained indicate that HSAF methodology provides a flexible VaR quantification, which fits the continuous oil price movements well and provides an efficient risk quantification. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Accurate and reliable quantitative measures of risk are needed to minimize undesirable effects on a given portfolio fromlarge fluctuations in market conditions. To accomplish this, a series of computational tools has beendesigned, implemented, and incorporated into MatRisk, an integratedenvironment for risk assessment developed in MATLAB. Besides standard measures, such as Value at Risk(VaR), the application includes other more sophisticated risk measures that address the inability of VaRproperly to characterize the structure of risk. Conditionalrisk measures can also be estimated for autoregressive models with heteroskedasticity, including some novel mixture models. These tools are illustrated with a comprehensive risk analysis of the Spanish IBEX35 stock index. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","This paper builds on the credit-scoring literature and proposes a method to calculate portfolio credit risk. Individual default risk estimates are used to compose a value-at-risk (VaR) measure of credit risk. In general, credit-scoring models suffer from a sample-selection bias. The starting point is therefore to estimate an unbiased scoring model using the bivariate probit approach. The paper uses a large data set with Swedish consumer credit data that contains extensive financial and personal information on both rejected and approved applicants. We study how marginal changes in a default-risk-based acceptance rule would shift the size of the bank's loan portfolio, its VaR exposure and average credit losses. Finally, we compare the risk in the sample portfolio with that in an efficiently provided portfolio of equal size. The results show that the size of a small consumer loan does not affect associated default risk, implying that the bank provides loans in a way that is not consistent with default-risk minimization. VaR calculations indicate that an efficient selection (by means of a default-riskbased rule) of loan applicants can reduce credit risk by up to 80%. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We formulate the StressVaR-x method to account for a fat-tailed distribution. Our results indicate that the StressVaR-x only outperforms the StressVaR marginally at the 99% confidence level when applying the models to stress test a portfolio comprising of eight Asian currencies that have been under severe stress in the recent years. In fact, at the 95% level, the StressVaR method performs better than the StressVaR-x method. Despite evidence of fat-tailed return distribution, we conclude that the normality assumption may still be appropriate in stress testing. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Each exposure's contribution to VaR is portfolio-invariant only if (a) dependence across exposures is driven by a single systematic risk factor, and (b) no exposure accounts for more than an arbitrarily small share of total portfolio exposure. Analysis of rates of convergence to asymptotic VaR leads to a simple and accurate portfolio-level add-on charge for undiversified idiosyncratic risk. There is no similarly simple way to address violation of the single factor assumption. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In fact, most definitions of ES lead to the same results when applied to continuous loss distributions. Differences may appear when the underlying loss distributions have discontinuities. In this case even the coherence property of ES can get lost unless one took care of the details in its definition. We compare some of the definitions of ES, pointing out that there is one which is robust in the sense of yielding a coherent risk measure regardless of the underlying distributions. Moreover, this ES can be estimated effectively even in cases where the usual estimators for VaR fail. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The paper considers how a bank's preference for a risk management system is affected by the presence of supervision by bank regulators. The model uses a principal-agent setting between a bank's owner and its risk management. The main conclusion is that previously unregulated institutions can be expected to switch to the lower quality standard approach subsequent to becoming regulated, i.e., the presence of regulation may induce a bank to decrease the quality of its risk management system. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Such distributions are of particular importance in applications because of the prevalence of models based on scenarios and finite sampling. CVaR is able to quantify dangers beyond VaR and moreover it is coherent. It provides optimization short-cuts which, through linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index tracking. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

As a close variant of models long used for insurance risk, it retains the analytical tractability for which the insurance models were designed. Value-at-risk (VaR) can be obtained via a recurrence-rule algorithm, so Monte Carlo simulation can be avoided. Little recoganized, however, is that the algorithm is fragile. Under empirically realistic conditions, numerical error can accumulate in the execution of the recurrence rule and produce wildly inaccurate results for VaR. This paper provides new tools for users of CreditRisk+ based on the cumulant generating function (cgf) of the portfolio loss distribution. Direct solution for the moments of the loss distribution from the cgf is almost instantaneous and is computationally robust. Thus, the moments provide a convenient, quick and independent diagnostic on the implementation and execution of the standard solution algorithm. Better still, with the cgf in hand we have an alternative to the standard algorithm. I show how tail percentiles of the loss distribution can be calculated quickly and easily by saddlepoint approximation. On a large and varied sample of simulated test portfolios, I find a natural complementarity between the two algorithms: Saddlepoint approximation is accurate and robust in those situations for which the standard algorithm performs least well, and is less accurate in those situations for which the standard algorithm is fast and reliable.

It is argued that since market data is endogenous to market behavior, statistical analysis made in times of stability does not provide much guidance in times of crisis. In an extensive survey across data classes and risk models, the empirical properties of current risk forecasting models are found to be lacking in robustness while being excessively volatile. For regulatory use, the VaR measure may give misleading information about risk, and in some cases may actually increase both idiosyncratic and systemic risk. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","In the first part of this paper we address the non-coherence of value-at-risk (VaR) as a risk measure in the context of portfolio credit risk, and highlight some problems which follow from this theoretical deficiency. In particular, a realistic demonstration of the non-subadditivity of VaR is given and the possibly nonsensical consequences of VaR-based portfolio optimisation are shown. The second part of the paper discusses VaR and expected shortfall estimation for large balanced credit portfolios. All standard industry models (Creditmetrics, KMV, Credit-Risk+) are presented as Bernoulli mixture models to facilitate their direct comparison. For homogeneous groups it is shown that measures of tail risk for the loss distribution may be approximated in large portfolios by analysing the tail of the mixture distribution in the Bernoulli representation. An example is given showing that, for portfolios of lower quality, choice of model has some impact on measures of extreme risk. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this space, the concept of \"risk aversion function\" φ naturally arises as the spectral representation of each risk measure in a space of functions of confidence level probabilities. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on φ for Mφ to be a coherent measure. We find in this way a simple interpretation of the concept of coherence and a way to map any rational investor's subjective risk aversion onto a coherent measure and vice-versa. We also provide for these measures their discrete versions Mφ(N) acting on finite sets of N independent realizations of a r.v. which are not only shown to be coherent measures for any fixed N, but also consistent estimators of Mφ for large N. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mathematically speaking, any methodology of allocating capital is a risk measure, i.e. a function mapping random variables to the real numbers. Nowadays value-at-risk (VaR), which is defined as a fixed level quantile of the random variable under consideration, is the most popular risk measure. Unfortunately, it fails to reward diversification, as it is not subadditive. In the search for a suitable alternative to VaR, expected shortfall (ES) (or conditional VaR or tail VaR) has been characterized as the smallest coherent and law invariant risk measure to dominate VaR. We discuss these and some other properties of ES as well as its generalization to a class of coherent risk measures which can incorporate higher moment effects. Moreover, we suggest a general method on how to attribute ES risk contributions to portfolio components. © 2002, Elsevier Science B.V.

A number of estimates based on the parametric and historical approaches to VAR are examined. It is found that the bias in the estimates of VAR are sensitive to the sample period and to the methodology chosen to estimate daily volatility. It appears that the estimates based on the exponentially weighted moving average volatility with a high decay factor are unbiased and relatively efficient. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The overnight prices can be used to compute 24 h returns for two international markets over exactly the same time interval, even though the countries in which these markets operate are in completely different time zones. These synchronous returns make it possible to compute accurate daily correlation measures, which can for example be used for daily value-at-risk (VaR).

We propose a new approach that relates financial market volatility to firm specific credit risk and integrates interest rate, interest rate spread, and foreign exchange rate risk into one overall fixed income portfolio risk assessment. Accounting for the correlation between these significant risk factors as well as portfolio diversification results in improved risk measurement and management. The methodology is shown to produce reasonable credit transition probabilities, prices for bonds with credit risk, and portfolio value-at-risk measures. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Given the widespread usage of VaR, it becomes increasingly important to study the effects of VaR based risk management on the prices of stocks and options. We solve a continuous-time asset pricing model, based on Lucas (1978) and Basak and Shapiro (2001), to investigate these effects. We find that the presence of risk managers tends to reduce market volatility, as intended. However, in some cases VaR risk management undesirably raises the probability of extreme losses. Finally, we demonstrate that option prices in an economy with VaR risk managers display a volatility smile. © 2002 Blackwell Publishers Ltd.","Filtered historical simulation provides the general framework to our backtests of portfolios of derivative securities held by a large sample of financial institutions.

Spurred by regulators and competitive pressures, more institutions are, reporting VAR numbers in annual and quarterly financial reports. To provide preliminary evidence on the informativeness of these new disclosures, I investigate the relation between the trading VAR disclosed by a small sample of U.S. commercial banks and the subsequent variability of their trading revenues. The empirical results suggest that VAR disclosures are informative in that they predict the variability of trading revenues. Thus, analysts and investors can use VAR disclosures to compare, the risk profiles of banks' trading portfolios.","This paper develops efficient methods for computing portfolio value-at-risk (VAR) when the underlying risk factors have a heavy-tailed distribution. In modeling heavy tails, we focus on multivariate t distributions and some extensions thereof. We develop two methods for VAR calculation that exploit a quadratic approximation to the portfolio loss, such as the delta-gamma approximation. In the first method, we derive the characteristic function of the quadratic approximation and then use numerical transform inversion to approximate the portfolio loss distribution. Because the quadratic approximation may not always yield accurate VAR estimates, we also develop a low variance Monte Carlo method. This method uses the quadratic approximation to guide the selection of an effective importance sampling distribution that samples risk factors so that large losses occur more often. Variance is further reduced by combining the importance sampling with stratified sampling. Numerical results on a variety of test portfolios indicate that large variance reductions are typically obtained. Both methods developed in this paper overcome difficulties associated with VAR calculation with heavy-tailed risk factors. The Monte Carlo method also extends to the problem of estimating the conditional excess, sometimes known as the conditional VAR.","It is well known that time series of returns are characterized by volatility clustering and excess kurtosis. Therefore, when modelling the dynamic behavior of returns, inference and prediction methods, based on independent and/or Gaussian observations may be inadequate. As bootstrap methods are not, in general, based on any particular assumption on the distribution of the data, they are well suited for the analysis of returns. This paper reviews the application of bootstrap procedures for inference and prediction of financial time series. In relation to inference, bootstrap techniques have been applied to obtain the sample distribution of statistics for testing, for example, autoregressive dynamics in the conditional mean and variance, unit roots in the mean, fractional integration in volatility and the predictive ability of technical trading rules. On the other hand, bootstrap procedures have been used to estimate the distribution of returns which is of interest, for example, for Value at Risk (VaR) models or for prediction purposes. Although the application of bootstrap techniques to the empirical analysis of financial time series is very broad, there are few analytical results on the statistical properties of these techniques when applied to heteroscedastic time series. Furthermore, there are quite a few papers where the bootstrap procedures used are not adequate.","This paper extends the multivariate latent factor ARCH model approach of Diebold and Nerlove (Journal of Applied Econometrics 4 (1989) 1) as a parsimonious alternative that pays particular attention to time series properties of daily foreign exchange rates such as jumps and to changing volatilities in both the common and country-specific factors. Using seven major daily dollar exchange rates from January 1 1992 to December 31 1996, this paper finds evidence of significant time-varying correlations and the country-specific variances. Consistent with the finding of Alexius and Sellin (1997) (A latent factor model of European exchange rate risk premia. Manuscript, The Economic Research Institute, Stockholm School of Economics), the two factor model appears to be a reasonable description of the major exchange rates. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","The use of close-to-close returns underestimates returns correlation because international stock markets have different trading hours. With the availability of 16:00 (London time) stock market series, we find dynamics of daily correlation and covariance, estimated using two non-synchroneity adjustment procedures, to be substantially different from their synchronous counterparts. Conditional correlation may have different signs depending on the model and data type used. Other findings include volatility spillover from the US to the UK (and France), and a reverse spillover which is not documented before. Also, unlike previous findings, we found the increase in daily correlation is prominent only under extremely adverse conditions when a large negative return has been registered. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","This study investigates whether intraday returns contain important information for forecasting daily volatility. Whereas in the existing literature volatility models for daily returns are improved by including intraday information such as the daily high and low, volume, the number of trades, and intraday returns, here the volatility of intraday returns is explicitly modelled. Daily volatility forecasts are constructed from multiple volatility forecasts for intraday intervals. It is shown for the DEM/USD and the YEN/USD exchange rates that this results in superior forecasts for daily volatility. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.","The following text is Standard &amp; Poor's official response to the Basel Committee's proposal, which was presented to the regulators in December 1999. Standard &amp; Poor's welcomes the opportunity to respond to the committee's proposal.

In a Black-Scholes setting we obtain closed-form explicit solutions and compare their form and implications to those of the classical continuous-time mean-variance problem. We also consider more general price processes that allow for larger fluctuations in the returns.","This paper characterizes the liquidity discount, the difference between the market value of a trader's position and its value when liquidated. This discount occurs whenever traders face downward sloping demand curves for shares and execution lags in selling shares. This characterization enables one to modify the standard value at risk (VaR) computation to include liquidity risk.","Estimates of average default probabilities for borrowers assigned to each of a financial institution's internal credit risk rating grades are crucial inputs to portfolio credit risk models. Such models are increasingly used in setting financial institution capital structure, in internal control and compensation systems, in asset-backed security design, and are being considered for use in setting regulatory capital requirements for banks. This paper empirically examines properties of the major methods currently used to estimate average default probabilities by grade. Evidence of potential problems of bias, instability, and gaming is presented. With care, and perhaps judicious application of multiple methods, satisfactory estimates may be possible. In passing, evidence is presented about other properties of internal and rating-agency ratings. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.","Value-at-Risk (VaR) has emerged as the standard tool for measuring market risk. Currently, more than 80 commercial vendors offer risk management systems that report VaR-like measures. Risk managers are therefore often left with the daunting task of choosing from a plethora of models. This paper develops a framework, first for testing that the VaR measure at hand is properly specified, and second for picking the best among two models in a statistically meaningful way. In an application, competing VaR measures are calculated from either historical or option-price-based volatility measures, and the VaRs are tested and compared. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The main contribution of the paper however is that we then model these two factors as simplified synthetic factors so that they may be used to develop an innovative approach to the computation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) for a portfolio of interest rate swaps. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.","This paper analyses the application of a switching volatility model to forecast the distribution of returns and to estimate the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of both single assets and portfolios.

Such tail behavior is important for risk management. In this article I focus on the calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a downside-risk measure for optimal asset portfolios. Using a framework centered on the Student-t distribution, I explicitly allow for a discrepancy between the fat-tailedness of the true distribution of asset returns and that of the distribution used by the investment manager. As a result, numbers for the overestimation or underestimation of the true VaR of a given portfolio can be computed. These numbers are used to rank several well-known estimation methods for determining the unknown parameters of the distribution of asset returns. Minimizing the absolute (percentage) mismatch between the nominal and actual or true VaR leads to the choice of a Gaussian maximum quasilikelihood estimator-that is, a least squares type of estimator. The maximum likelihood estimator has less satisfactory behavior. Outlier-robust estimators perform even worse if the required confidence level for the VaR is high.

In statistics, extremes of a random process refer to the lowest observation (the minimum) and to the highest observation (the maximum) over a given time-period. Extreme value theory gives some interesting results about the distribution of extreme returns. In particular, the limiting distribution of extreme returns observed over a long time-period is largely independent of the distribution of returns itself. In financial markets, extreme price movements correspond to market corrections during ordinary periods, and also to stock market crashes, bond market collapses or foreign exchange crises during extraordinary periods. An approach based on extreme values to compute the VaR thus covers market conditions ranging from the usual environment considered by the existing VaR methods to the financial crises which are the focus of stress testing. Univariate extreme value theory is used to compute the VaR of a fully aggregated position while multivariate extreme value theory is used to compute the VaR of a position decomposed on risk factors. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.","This study investigates the consequences of dynamics in the term structure of Dutch interest rates for the accurateness of value-at-risk models.

Our approach combines pseudo-maximum-likelihood fitting of GARCH models to estimate the current volatility and extreme value theory (EVT) for estimating the tail of the innovation distribution of the GARCH model. We use our method to estimate conditional quantiles (VaR) and conditional expected shortfalls (the expected size of a return exceeding VaR), this being an alternative measure of tail risk with better theoretical properties than the quantile. Using backtesting of historical daily return series we show that our procedure gives better 1-day estimates than methods which ignore the heavy tails of the innovations or the stochastic nature of the volatility. With the help of our fitted models we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to estimating the conditional quantiles of returns over multiple-day horizons and find that this outperforms the simple square-root-of-time scaling method. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.","We propose a methodology for modelling the value at risk of a complex portfolio, based on an extension of the Ho, Stapleton and Subrahmanyam technique. We model the variance-covariance structure of up to seven variables. These could represent four country indices and three exchange rates, for example. In addition, the effect of an arbitrary number of orthogonal factors can be analysed. The system is illustrated by estimating the value at risk for a portfolio of international stocks where the factors are stock market indices and exchange rates, a portfolio of international bonds where the factors are interest rates as well as exchange rates, and a portfolio of interest rate derivatives in different currencies. In this last case, we model a two-factor term structure of interest rates in each of the currencies, valuing the derivatives at a future date using these term structures and the Black model. The model is applied for different fineness of the binomial density and computational accuracy and efficiency are estimated.

Current risk management techniques failing to take this additional downside risk into account will underestimate the true Value-at-Risk with greater severity during periods of financial turnoil. We provide a conditional approach to the Value-at-Risk methodology, known as conditional VaR-x, which to capture the time variation of non-normalities allows for additional tail fatness in the distribution of expected returns. These conditional VaR-x estimates are then compared to those based on the RiskMetrics™ methodology from J.P. Morgan, where we find that the model provides improved forecasts of the Value-at-Risk. We are therefore able to show that our conditional VaR-x estimates are better able to capture the nature of downside risk, particularly crucial in times of financial crises. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These tools include the calculation of VaR contribution, marginal VaR and trade risk profiles. We first review the parametric, or delta-normal, versions of these tools and then extend them to the simulation-based, or non-parametric, case. We analyze two sample portfolios: one, consisting of foreign exchange contracts, is well-suited for parametric analysis while the other, which contains European options, is best addressed with simulation-based methods. The limitations of the simulation-based approach, due to the potential effects of sampling error, are also discussed.","The problem of estimating Value-at-Risk (VAR) statistics for Brady bond portfolios is addressed by using a modified GARCH model with a superimposed 'jump' innovation that affects not only instantaneous spreads but subsequent volatilities. Cross-country correlations are extracted from each country's individual 'non-jump' standardized innovations on a rolling basis. In addition, the results show that by allowing the jump frequencies to depend on variables such as contagion effects, the accuracy of VAR estimates may be improved.","An extended simulation-based risk management toolkit developed on top of the analytical tools presented by Litterman is introduced. These tools provide additional insights when the portfolio contains non-linearities, when the market distributions are not normal or when there are multiple horizons.

<h2 id="what-is-value-at-risk">What is Value-at-Risk?</h2>
<p>The basic idea behind Value-at-Risk to investors of the worst-case outcome for their portfolios. A simplistic question an investor might ask is: “How much would I lose if I suffer an extreme negative shock?”. This is generally calculated by focusing on the portfolio’s return being in the extreme 5th or 1st percentile of the distribution. In such a circumstance the loss suffered is called the value-at-risk (VaR). VaR can be thought of as being a quantile of a distribution, as it is the portfolio loss associated with an extreme left tailed percentile of the return distribution. The quantile, <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, of a particular distribution is the cut-off point below which <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>% of the distribution’s values lie. A common quantile that people are familiar with is the median, which is the value below which 50% of the distribution’s values lie. It can also be viewed from the opposing direction meaning that 50% of the distribution’s values lie above this median value also. When we calculate VaR we generally focus on a 1% or 5% Var, meaning that 99% or 95% of returns will be higher than the calculated VaR value and only 1% or 5% of the portfolio’s returns will be worse than the VaR figure.</p>
<p>Often VaR is illustrated by assuming a bell shaped normal distribution of portfolio returns. This is due to the ease of exposition when using a normal distribution of returns. In such a circumstance one can calculate VaR by using only the first two moments of the distribution, i.e., the mean and standard deviation. Firstly, we should sort the return values from high to low, and after doing so we can, use statistical tables to determine that a 1% VaR value of for a standard normal distribution (i.e., mean=0, standard deviation=1) is equal to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\textit{$1\%-VaR$} = \mu - 2.33\sigma,\]</span></p>
where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is equal to mean of the normally distributed portfolio returns, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is their standard deviation.\

<p>Expected Shortfall is another leading measure of tail risk; a measure that is preferred by many practitioners in place of VaR. If we think back to the situation where we look at the 1% worst-case of future portfolio returns, the VaR is the most optimistic scenario, as it provides you with the cut-off point below which all the worst-case returns lie. Essentially the VaR is the best case of the worst case outcomes. It does not provide the user with the magnitudes of the potential losses further out the tail. It is for this reason that Expected Shortfall (ES) (sometimes referred to as Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE)) is used. Instead of focusing on the quantile-based cut-off point the ES takes the average of the worst 1% of returns. Again assuming normally distributed returns for simplicity, we follow Treussand (2007) ``The Non-monotonicity of Value-at-Risk and the Validity of Risk Measures over Different Horizons", and represent ES as: <span class="math display">\[ES=\frac{1}{0.05} \exp(\mu)\textit{N}[-\sigma - \textit{F}(0.95)]-1.\]</span> In the above equation, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> represents the mean of the continuously compounded returns, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> their standard deviation. <span class="math inline">\(\textit{N}\)</span> represents the standard normal distribution and <span class="math inline">\(\textit{F}\)</span> is its inverse.</p>
<p>An issue that both VaR and ES face is that if they are often calculated based on historical returns only. This means that very few observations of worst case scenarios inform tail risk measures calculated, meaning that they can suffer from large estimation errors.</p>

%#######################Back to recommendations harvested from KTP App -edited slightly############################# %Add VaR Lit Review based recommendations to the below

<p>\ Funds-Axis have a straightforward route to market through their existing client base and are already aware via customer feedback that demand for this new product exists. They can use that as their route to market for the solution that this Innovation Voucher will create.</p>
<p>As they hold the client data already, and the demand is there from an estimated 50% of their existing clients to apply VaR models to their portfolios, this will enable them to release a new premium bundled solution which incorporates VaR and Risk Analytical with immediate revenue returns.</p>
<p>The product could be initially marketed to existing clients. This could be through in-app marketing to customers where they will see the new modules and be able to trial it and also through CRM engagement which will commence at the appropriate point during the project.</p>
<p>Funds-Axis could then move to look at new clients, including: Through RFPs where they are responding to client requests for information, which almost invariably include a VaR component. Through proactive marketing and co-ordinated campaign management, coupled with a dedicated sales effort.</p>
<p>\ The Funds-Axis revenue model is to charge on a per portfolio per module per annum basis, with all deals being recurring annual revenue.</p>
<p>Within the current revenue, they have c.1,000 portfolios which subscribe to modules worth between £1,000 and £2,500 per fund.</p>
<p>VaR (plus back testing and stress testing) is a bespoke premium solution that typically prices at c. £2,750 - £3,500 per portfolio per annum. This is the price at which they resell 3rd party solutions to those of customers who want us to provide it.</p>
<p>Whilst, it is not Funds-Axis’ plan to push for a really low cost solution, price disruption is an element of what they are hoping to achieve. They assume they can make a risk solution available at £1,250 per portfolio per annum and may be able to push closer to £2,250. The figures below are based on the simple assumption that they can charge c. £1,250 per investment portfolio.</p>
<p>They have factored in the following costs, which are the expected incremental costs and are in line with requirements for the existing solution:</p>
<p>Incremental headcount to increase by 2 a year to increasing to 10 over 5 years and with average salaries of £50k. Datacosts £25k per annum Technology infrastructure costs - £25k per annum Other costs i.e. marketing costs, sales, other business development costs, provision for legal costs for any IP protection, potential 3rd party review/audit of the calculations etc., rising from £50k to £250k over the 5 years A. Premium VaR Solution – this service be charged at (assumption) £1.25k per investment portfolio</p>
<p>During project: 0</p>
<p>Yr 1: No of Portfolios 200, income of £250k, costs c. £200k, net profit is 20% = £50k net profit</p>
<p>Yr 2: No of Portfolios 400, income of £500k, costs c. £350k, net profit is 30% = £150k net profit</p>
<p>Yr 3: No of Portfolios 600, income of £750k, costs c. £500k, net profit is 33.3% = £250k net profit</p>
<p>Yr 4: No of Portfolios 800, income of £1m, costs c. £650k, net profit is 35% = £350k net profit</p>
<p>Yr 5: No of Portfolios 1000, income of £1.25m, costs c. £800k, net profit is 36% = £450k net profit</p>
<p>\ In order to bring this solution to market the company will commit to the following costs:</p>
<p>Data costs: They will need to incur significant data costs, including during the build phase. We anticipate these costs to be approximately £75,000 over 3 years. Technology infrastructure costs will be in the region of £25k per annum. Staff costs: They will need to develop a dedicated risk team. It is the intention of the company to create two new technical roles in this area, this would be two experienced professionals with salaries of approximately £50,000 per annum. An incremental headcount to increase by 10 over 5 years and with average costs of £50,000 is to be factored in. Development costs: In order to develop the commercialised solution it is anticipated that the development costs will be in the region of £150k. Funds-Axis will also need to invest in marketing, business development and sales to ensure that their existing clients are aware of the new offering and that they can attract new clients. Provision for IP and audit/accreditation costs have also been considered.</p>
